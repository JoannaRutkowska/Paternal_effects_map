THE CONTRIBUTION OF NON-GENETIC MATERNAL EFFECTS TO OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE IS WELL ESTABLISHED AND THE EVIDENCE FOR PATERNAL EFFECTS HAS ALSO BEEN INCREASING RECENTLY. STUDIES DETERMINING THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF THE TWO PARENTS TO OFFSPRING SUCCESS ARE, HOWEVER, STILL RARE. 2. IN THIS STUDY, TWO STRESSORS WERE APPLIED TO ADULT RED FLOUR BEETLES (TRIBOLIUM CASTANEUM)STARVATION AND COLD STRESSAND A FULL-FACTORIAL DESIGN WAS USED TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL REPRODUCTIVE DECISIONS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE OFFSPRING. 3. STARVATION HAD A STRONGER NEGATIVE EFFECT THAN COLD STRESS ON BOTH MALES AND FEMALES, AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF STARVED FEMALES PRODUCING OFFSPRING WAS VERY LOW. FURTHERMORE, STARVED FATHERS LED TO LOWER OFFSPRING MASS AT THE LARVAL STAGE, PROBABLY LEADING TO IMPAIRED STARVATION TOLERANCE OF THE OFFSPRING. 4. COLD-STRESSED FATHERS WERE LESS LIKELY THAN UNSTRESSED FATHERS TO REPRODUCE, WHEREAS COLD-STRESSED MOTHERS DEMONSTRATED A SIMILAR EFFECT BY PRODUCING FEWER OFFSPRING. 5. APPLYING STRESS PROBABLY LED TO ENERGY SAVING THAT CAME AT THE EXPENSE OF REPRODUCTION INTENSITY. IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THE SMALLER OFFSPRING MASS IS A NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCE OF THE PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO STRESS. 6. THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE TWO STRESSORS APPLIED AND BETWEEN THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF EACH PARENT COULD PERHAPS BE EXPLAINED BY THE DISTINCT PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSES OF EACH SEX TO EACH OF THE STRESSORS. 2019 THE ROYAL ENTOMOLOGICAL SOCIETY",NA,NA,"EENTD","SCHARF, I.; SCHOOL OF ZOOLOGY, FACULTY OF LIFE SCIENCES, TEL AVIV UNIVERSITYISRAEL; EMAIL: SCHARFI@TAUEX.TAU.AC.IL","ARTICLE","10.1111/een.12726","ALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT-STIFTUNGALEXANDER VON HUMBOLDT-STIFTUNG ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION,ISF,442/16","03076946","ECOLOGICAL ENTOMOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,0,"4",NA,"494-501","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","SEPARATION BETWEEN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING FOLLOWING EXPOSURE OF ADULT RED FLOUR BEETLES TO TWO STRESSORS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061583565&doi=10.1111%2feen.12726&partnerID=40&md5=30cfc0f0716ab1ccaed8f06c02bb3f7a","44",2019,"WE ARE GRATEFUL TO THE ISRAEL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (GRANT NO. 442/16) FOR FUNDING THIS STUDY.

POLLUT.","BISPHENOL A (BPA) IS AN ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR WHOSE UBIQUITOUS PRESENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN RELATED WITH IMPAIRMENT OF MALE REPRODUCTION. BPA CAN CAUSE BOTH TRANSCRIPTOMIC AND EPIGENETIC CHANGES DURING SPERMATOGENESIS. TO EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF MALE EXPOSURE TO BPA, ADULT ZEBRAFISH MALES WERE EXPOSED DURING SPERMATOGENESIS TO DOSES OF 100 AND 2000 G/L, WHICH WERE REPORTED IN CONTAMINATED WATER BODIES AND HIGHER THAN THOSE ALLOWED FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION. FERTILIZATION CAPACITY AND SURVIVAL AT HATCHING WERE ANALYSED AFTER MATING WITH UNTREATED FEMALES. SPERMATOGENIC PROGRESS WAS ANALYSED THROUGH A MORPHOMETRICAL STUDY OF TESTES AND APOPTOSIS WAS EVALUATED BY TUNEL ASSAY. TESTICULAR GENE EXPRESSION WAS EVALUATED BY RT-QPCR AND EPIGENETICS BY USING ELISA AND IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY. IN VITRO STUDIES WERE PERFORMED TO INVESTIGATE THE ROLE OF GPER. CHROMATIN FRAGMENTATION AND THE PRESENCE OF TRANSCRIPTS WERE ALSO EVALUATED IN EJACULATED SPERM. RESULTS ON TESTES FROM MALES TREATED WITH THE HIGHEST DOSE SHOWED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN SPERMATOCYTES, AN INCREASE IN APOPTOSIS, A DOWNREGULATION OF CCNB1 AND SYCP3, ALL OF WHICH POINT TO AN ALTERATION OF SPERMATOGENESIS AND TO MEIOTIC ARREST AND AN UPREGULATION OF GPER1 AND ESRRGA RECEPTORS. ADDITIONALLY, BPA AT 2000 G/L CAUSED MISSREGULATION OF EPIGENETIC REMODELLING ENZYMES TRANSCRIPTS IN TESTES AND PROMOTED DNA HYPERMETHYLATION AND H3K27ME3 DEMETHYLATION. BPA ALSO TRIGGERED AN INCREASE IN HISTONE ACETYLTRANSFERASE ACTIVITY, WHICH LED TO HYPERACETYLATION OF HISTONES (H3K9AC, H3K14AC, H4K12AC). IN VITRO REVERSION OF HISTONE ACETYLATION CHANGES USING A SPECIFIC GPER ANTAGONIST, G-36, SUGGESTED THIS RECEPTOR AS MEDIATOR OF HISTONE HYPERACETYLATION.

J. NEUROSCI.","OUR PREVIOUS WORK INDICATED THAT MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE, OFFSPRING OF COCAINE-EXPERIENCED SIRES DISPLAY BLUNTED COCAINE SELF-ADMINISTRATION. WE EXTENDED THIS LINE OF INVESTIGATION TO EXAMINE BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION, A COMMONLY USED MODEL OF COCAINE-INDUCED BEHAVIORAL AND NEURONAL PLASTICITY. RESULTS INDICATED THAT MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE, OFFSPRING OF COCAINE-TAKING SIRES SHOWED DEFICITS IN THE ABILITY OF REPEATED SYSTEMIC COCAINE INJECTIONS TO INDUCE AUGMENTED LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY. THE REDUCED COCAINE SENSITIZATION PHENOTYPE IN MALE PROGENY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN HISTONE POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS, EPIGENETIC PROCESSES THAT REGULATE GENE EXPRESSION BY CONTROLLING THE ACCESSIBILITY OF GENES TO TRANSCRIPTIONAL MACHINERY, IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS OF FIRST-GENERATION MALE PROGENY. THUS, FIVE HISTONE POST-TRANSLATIONAL MODIFICATIONS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED IN THE MALE PROGENY OF COCAINE-EXPOSED SIRES. IN CONTRAST, SELF-ADMINISTRATION OF NICOTINE WAS UNALTERED IN MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING SUGGESTING THAT THE INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF PATERNAL COCAINE TAKING MAY BE DRUG-SPECIFIC. INTERESTINGLY, THE REDUCED SENSITIVITY TO COCAINE PREVIOUSLY OBSERVED IN THE MALE OFFSPRING OF COCAINE-TAKING SIRES DISSIPATED IN THE GRAND-OFFSPRING. BOTH MALE AND FEMALE GRAND-PROGENY OF COCAINE-EXPOSED SIRES SHOWED UNALTERED COCAINE-INDUCED BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION AND COCAINE SELF-ADMINISTRATION. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT PATERNAL COCAINE TAKING PRODUCES CHANGES IN MULTIPLE COCAINE ADDICTION-RELATED BEHAVIORS IN MALE PROGENY, WHICH DO NOT PERSIST BEYOND THE FIRST GENERATION OF OFFSPRING. MOREOVER, THE ALTERED SENSITIVITY TO COCAINE IN FIRST-GENERATION MALE PROGENY OF COCAINE-SIRED MALE OFFSPRING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS IN THE NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS, A NUCLEUS THAT PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN COCAINE-ASSOCIATED BEHAVIORAL PLASTICITY. 2018 FEDERATION OF EUROPEAN NEUROSCIENCE SOCIETIES AND JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD",NA,NA,"EJONE","PIERCE, R.C.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, CENTER FOR NEUROBIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIAUNITED STATES; EMAIL: RCPIERCE@PENNMEDICINE.UPENN.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1111/ejn.14310","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,R01 DA033641 R21 DA040837,K01 DA039308,GM110104,AI118891,R21 DA039393,K02 DA18678,R01037897","0953816X","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,1,"9",NA,"1115-1126","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","30565761","SCOPUS","IMPAIRED COCAINE-INDUCED BEHAVIORAL PLASTICITY IN THE MALE OFFSPRING OF COCAINE-EXPERIENCED SIRES",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059614689&doi=10.1111%2fejn.14310&partnerID=40&md5=f9c18e791cb91ef8324763bf04af5cf6","49",2019,"THE AUTHORS THANK RACHEL SCHASSBURGER, THOMAS HOPKINS, BLAKE KIMMEY, AND JOHN MAURER FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, MARK ALTER FOR HELP WITH THE BEHAVIORAL SENSITIZATION EXPERIMENT, AND LISA BRIAND FOR ADVICE ON EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN.

COMP. NEUROL., 522, PP. 1031-104","BRAIN RES. BULL.","THE DEVELOPING BRAIN IS EXTREMELY SENSITIVE TO DRUGS DURING ADOLESCENCE. THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF OPIOID ABUSE IN THIS CRITICAL PERIOD NOT ONLY DO INVOLVE INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO ARE WITNESSED IN THE SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS. THEREFORE, WHAT IS RECOGNIZED AS THE POPULATION SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF OPIOID ABUSE COULD BE MUCH GREATER IN NUMBER. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPLORED THE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF MORPHINE EXPOSURE IN ADOLESCENT STAGE ON MORPHINE REWARD IN MALE OFFSPRING THROUGH THE PATRILINE. MALE WISTAR RATS UNDERWENT 10 DAYS OF INCREMENTAL DOSES OF MORPHINE ADMINISTRATION DURING ADOLESCENCE; THE BROAD SPECTRUM OF NEUROBEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS IN RAT ADOLESCENCE IS AKIN TO THAT OF HUMAN ADOLESCENCE. THEREAFTER, FOLLOWING A 20-DAY WASH-OUT PERIOD, ADULT MALES COPULATED WITH NAVE FEMALES. THE ADULT MALE OFFSPRING WERE EXAMINED FOR MORPHINE (0, 1, 2 AND 5 MG/KG)-INDUCED CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE (CPP). MOREOVER, THE SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY OF VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA (VTA) DOPAMINE (DA) NEURONS WAS INVESTIGATED UTILIZING EXTRACELLULAR SINGLE-UNIT RECORDING TECHNIQUE. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT PATERNAL MORPHINE EXPOSURE PRIOR TO CONCEPTION LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TOLERANCE TO THE REWARDING EFFECTS OF MORPHINE AT THE LOW DOSE OF 1 MG/KG (RIGHTWARD SHIFT IN DOSE-EFFECT CURVE). FURTHERMORE, MORPHINE-SIRED RATS ELICITED A DECREASE IN SPONTANEOUS BURST FIRING OF VTA DA NEURONS (BURST EVENT FREQUENCY, BURSTING ACTIVITY AND BURST DURATION) COMPARED TO SALINE-SIRED ONES. HENCE, OUR STUDY HAS PROVIDED EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL MORPHINE EXPOSURE DURING ADOLESCENCE ALTERS THE REWARDING EFFECTS OF MORPHINE IN MALE OFFSPRING. THIS EFFECT MAY BE MEDIATED IN PART BY A DECREASE IN PHASIC ACTIVATION OF VTA DA NEURONS. 2019 ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"DOPAMINE, 51-61-6, 62-31-7; MORPHINE, 52-26-6, 57-27-2; SODIUM CHLORIDE, 7647-14-5","BRBUD","AZIZI, H.; DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY, FACULTY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, TARBIAT MODARES UNIVERSITYIRAN; EMAIL: AZIZIH@MODARES.AC.IR","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.brainresbull.2019.02.004","IRAN NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONIRAN NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION COGNITIVE SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES COUNCILCOGNITIVE SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES COUNCIL,95P31 FACULTY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITYFACULTY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, NEWCASTLE UNIVERSITY TARBIAT MODARES UNIVERSITYTARBIAT MODARES UNIVERSITY","03619230","BRAIN RESEARCH BULLETIN","ENGLISH",NA,NA,1,NA,NA,"124-132","ELSEVIER INC.","30769129","SCOPUS","PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO MORPHINE DURING ADOLESCENCE INDUCES REWARD-RESISTANT PHENOTYPE TO MORPHINE IN MALE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062015579&doi=10.1016%2fj.brainresbull.2019.02.004&partnerID=40&md5=8a084d4a7024342088cf78bd0f6a4024","147",2019,"THIS WORK IS SUPPORTED BY THE COGNITIVE SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGIES COUNCIL OF IRAN (CSTC, GRANT NO. 95P31 ), THE IRAN NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (INSF) AND THE FACULTY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, TARBIAT MODARES UNIVERSITY , TEHRAN, IRAN.

RES.","BACKGROUND/AIMS: PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO ADVERSE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS CAN ACT ON OFFSPRING'S PHENOTYPE AND INFLUENCE OFFSPRING'S LATER LIFE DISEASE RISK. OUR STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF FEEDING MALE RATS BEFORE MATING A HIGH-FAT, HIGH-SUCROSE AND HIGH-SALT DIET (HFSSD) OVER TWO GENERATIONS (F0 AND F1) ON THEIR OFFSPRING'S (F2) LIVER FUNCTION AND GUT MICROBIOME COMPOSITION. METHODS: MALE F0 RATS AND MALE F1 RATS WERE FED EITHER CONTROL DIET OR HFSSD BEFORE MATING. LIVER FUNCTION OF F2 OFFSPRING WAS INVESTIGATED, AND THEIR GUT MICROBIOME COMPOSITION WAS ANALYZED BY 16S RRNA GENE SEQUENCING IN THE F2 OFFSPRING OF RATS WHOSE FATHERS AND GRANDFATHERS WERE FED WITH CONTROL DIET (CD) (F0CD+F1CD-F2 GROUP) OR HFSSD PRIOR TO MATING (F0HD+F1HD-F2 GROUP). RESULTS: F2 OFFSPRING HAD HIGHER SERUM ASPARTATE AMINOTRANSFERASE ACTIVITY (FEMALE, P < 0.05 AND MALE, P < 0.01 RESPECTIVELY) COMPARED WITH CONTROL. SHANNON INDEXES OF GUT MICROBIOTA INDICATED A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER DIVERSITY IN THE FEMALE F0HD+F1HD-F2 AS COMPARED TO F0CD+F1CD-F2 FEMALE OFFSPRING (P < 0.01). THE DOMINANT PHYLA OF ALL THE GROUPS WERE BACTEROIDETES, FIRMICUTES AND PROTEOBACTERIA. THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN GUT BACTERIAL COMMUNITY COMPOSITION AT PHYLA AND GENUS LEVEL BETWEEN THE F0CD+F1CD-F2 AND F0HD+F1HD-F2. FURTHERMORE, THE VARIATION IN THE RELATIVE ABUNDANCE (PERCENTAGE) OF BACTERIAL GENUS IN THE F2 OFFSPRING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH LIVER FUNCTION ALTERATIONS INDUCED BY A PATERNAL PRE-CONCEPTIONAL UNHEALTHY DIET. MALE F0HD+F1HD-F2 OFFSPRING HAD HIGHER SERUM CHOLESTEROL, HIGH DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS AS WELL AS LOW DENSITY LIPOPROTEINS CONCENTRATIONS COMPARED TO THE CORRESPONDING MALE CONTROL RATS. CONCLUSION: TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR FINDINGS SUGGESTED THAT A PATERNAL PRE-CONCEPTIONAL UNHEALTHY DIET PREDISPOSES THE OFFSPRING TO MILD LIVER FUNCTION ALTERATIONS AND ALTERATIONS OF GUT MICROBIOTA IN LATER LIFE. EFFECTS ON LIPIDS WERE SEX-SPECIFIC AND ONLY SEEN IN MALE OFFSPRING. 2019 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY S.

REGEN. RES.","IT IS WIDELY KNOWN THAT MATERNAL PHYSICAL EXERCISE IS ABLE TO INDUCE BENEFICIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN OFFSPRING COGNITION; HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL EXERCISE HAVE NOT BEEN EXPLORED IN DETAIL. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE IMPACT OF PATERNAL PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON MEMORY AND LEARNING, NEUROPLASTICITY AND DNA METHYLATION LEVELS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF MALE OFFSPRING. ADULT MALE WISTAR RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: SEDENTARY OR EXERCISED FATHERS. THE PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION EXERCISE PROTOCOL CONSISTED OF TREADMILL RUNNING, 20 MINUTES DAILY, 5 CONSECUTIVE DAYS PER WEEK FOR 22 DAYS, WHILE THE MOTHERS WERE NOT TRAINED. AFTER MATING, PATERNAL SPERM WAS COLLECTED FOR GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS. AT POSTNATAL DAY 53, THE OFFSPRING WERE EUTHANIZED, AND THE HIPPOCAMPUS WAS DISSECTED TO MEASURE CELL SURVIVAL BY 5-BROMO-2-DEOXIURIDINE AND TO DETERMINE THE EXPRESSION OF SYNAPTOPHYSIN, REELIN, BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR AND GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION LEVELS. TO MEASURE SPATIAL MEMORY AND LEARNING CHANGES IN OFFSPRING, THE MORRIS WATER MAZE PARADIGM WAS USED. THERE WAS AN IMPROVEMENT IN SPATIAL LEARNING, AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN HIPPOCAMPAL GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION LEVELS IN THE OFFSPRING FROM EXERCISED FATHERS COMPARED WITH THOSE FROM SEDENTARY ONES; HOWEVER, NO CHANGES WERE OBSERVED IN NEUROPLASTICITY BIOMARKERS BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR, REELIN AND 5-BROMO-2-DEOXIURIDINE. FINALLY, THE GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION OF PATERNAL SPERM WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED BY PHYSICAL EXERCISE. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST A LINK BETWEEN PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND COGNITIVE BENEFIT, WHICH MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIPPOCAMPAL EPIGENETIC PROGRAMMING IN MALE OFFSPRING. HOWEVER, THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF THIS MODULATION REMAIN UNCLEAR. 2019 MEDKNOW PUBLICATIONS.

HOWEVER, THE IMPACT OF THIS FORM OF EXPOSURE ON OFFSPRING VULNERABILITY TO STRESS IS UNKNOWN. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EVALUATE THE BEHAVIOURAL AND EPIGENETIC EFFECTS OF STRESS IN THE OFFSPRING OF MALE RATS WHOSE FATHERS WERE EXPOSED TO CANNABINOIDS DURING ADOLESCENCE. MALE ADOLESCENT OFFSPRING OF WIN55,212-2 (1.2 MG/KG) TREATED RATS WERE EXPOSED DURING ONE WEEK TO VARIABLE STRESSORS AND SUBJECTED TO BEHAVIOURAL TESTS OF ANXIETY AND EPISODIC-LIKE MEMORY, FOLLOWED BY AN ASSESSMENT OF GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION AND EXPRESSION OF DNA METHYLTRANSFERASES ENZYMES DNMT1 AND DNMT3A MRNA IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX. STRESS EXPOSURE INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT ANXIOGENIC-LIKE EFFECT BUT DID NOT AFFECT THE EPISODIC-LIKE MEMORY IN THE OFFSPRING OF WIN55,212-2 EXPOSED FATHERS IN COMPARISON TO THE OFFSPRING OF NON-EXPOSED FATHERS. THESE BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES WERE SUBSEQUENT TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION AND DNMT1 AND DNMTA3 TRANSCRIPTION IN THE PREFRONTAL CORTEX. THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT THE DELETERIOUS EFFECT OF CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO CANNABINOIDS DURING ADOLESCENCE ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS BUT MAY INCREASE THE VULNERABILITY TO STRESS-INDUCED ANXIETY IN THE OFFSPRING AND ALTER THEIR EPIGENETIC PROGRAMMING. 2018 ISDN",NA,"2,3 DIHYDRO 5 METHYL 3 (MORPHOLINOMETHYL) 6 (1 NAPHTHOYL)PYRROLO[1,2,3 DE][1,4]BENZOXAZINE, 134959-51-6; CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; DNA (CYTOSINE 5) METHYLTRANSFERASE; DNA (CYTOSINE 5) METHYLTRANSFERASE 1; BENZOXAZINES; CALCIUM CHANNEL BLOCKERS; CANNABINOIDS; CORTICOSTERONE; DNA (CYTOSINE-5-)-METHYLTRANSFERASE 1; DNA (CYTOSINE-5-)-METHYLTRANSFERASES; DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 3A; DNMT1 PROTEIN, RAT; MORPHOLINES; NAPHTHALENES; WIN 55212-2","IJDND","ABBOUSSI, O.; INSTITUTE OF ACADEMIC ANAESTHESIA, DIVISION OF NEUROSCIENCE, NINEWELLS HOSPITAL AND MEDICAL SCHOOL, UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEEUNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: OABBOUSSI@DUNDEE.AC.UK","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.ijdevneu.2018.11.007",NA,"07365748","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL NEUROSCIENCE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,2,NA,NA,"48-54","ELSEVIER LTD","30476535","SCOPUS","BEHAVIOURAL AND EPIGENETIC EFFECTS OF PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO CANNABINOIDS DURING ADOLESCENCE ON OFFSPRING VULNERABILITY TO STRESS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85057164395&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijdevneu.2018.11.007&partnerID=40&md5=c3961cac052be99e24fc27aeb5451a47","72",2019,"NA NA NA","MOHAMMED V UNIVERSITY IN RABAT;UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF DUNDEEUNITED KINGDOM;NOTREPORTED",NA,"IBN LAHMAR ANDALOUSSI Z, 2019, INT J DEV NEUROSCI","IBN LAHMAR ANDALOUSSI Z, 2019, INT J DEV NEUROSCI"

HERE WE SHOW THAT OYSTER LARVAE HAVE HIGHER SURVIVAL TO OSHV-1 WHEN THEIR MOTHERS, BUT NOT THEIR FATHERS, ARE EXPOSED TO POLY(I:C) PRIOR TO SPAWNING. RNA-SEQ PROVIDED NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO POLY(I:C) RECONFIGURES ANTIVIRAL GENE EXPRESSION IN UNCHALLENGED LARVAE. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE IMPROVED SURVIVAL OF LARVAE MIGHT OCCUR VIA MATERNAL PROVISIONING OF ANTIVIRAL COMPOUNDS IN THE EGGS. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"POLYINOSINIC POLYCYTIDYLIC ACID, 24939-03-5, 26301-44-0; RNA, 63231-63-0; ANTIVIRAL AGENTS; POLY I-C; VIRAL VACCINES","DCIMD","GREEN, T.; VANCOUVER ISLAND UNIVERSITY, CENTRE FOR SHELLFISH RESEARCH, DEPARTMENT OF FISHERIES AND AQUACULTURECANADA; EMAIL: TIMOTHY.GREEN@VIU.CA","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.dci.2018.09.022","MACQUARIE UNIVERSITYMACQUARIE UNIVERSITY,9201300681 NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADANATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA,RGPIN-2018-06761 CANADA RESEARCH CHAIRSCANADA RESEARCH CHAIRS,950-231856","0145305X","DEVELOPMENTAL AND COMPARATIVE IMMUNOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,2,NA,NA,"17-25","ELSEVIER LTD","30278186","SCOPUS","TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY AND ANTIVIRAL IMMUNITY IN THE PACIFIC OYSTER (CRASSOSTREA GIGAS) AGAINST OSTREID HERPESVIRUS 1 (OSHV-1)",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056176022&doi=10.1016%2fj.dci.2018.09.022&partnerID=40&md5=9ea85f03214d796c61fd1d089efa9a72","91",2019,"THE AUTHORS ACKNOWLEDGE FUNDING PROVIDED TO T.

J. OBES.","BACKGROUND:: OBESITY IS A HETEROGENEOUS PHENOTYPE AND RISK ASSOCIATIONS TO NON-COMMUNICABLE DISEASES SUCH AS CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE AND TYPE 2 DIABETES ARE INFLUENCED BY SEVERAL FACTORS. THE PATERNAL METABOLIC STATUS AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION INFLUENCES OFFSPRING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DEVELOPING OBESITY AND ADIPOSITY-ASSOCIATED CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASE. CHOLESTATIC LIVER DISEASES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAISED CIRCULATING SERUM BILE ACID LEVELS AND DYSLIPIDEMIA, AND ARE COMMONLY TREATED WITH URSODEOXYCHOLIC ACID (UDCA). WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT PATERNAL CHOLESTASIS ALTERS OFFSPRING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO DEVELOPING OBESITY AND ADIPOSITY-ASSOCIATED CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASE AND THAT THIS MAY BE MODIFIED BY PATERNAL UDCA TREATMENT. METHODS:: CHOLESTASIS WAS INDUCED IN MALE C57BL/6 MICE WITH A 0.5% CHOLIC ACID (CA)-SUPPLEMENTED DIET FOR 10 WEEKS PRIOR TO MATING WITH NORMAL CHOW (NC)-FED FEMALES. OFFSPRING OF CHOLESTATIC AND NC-FED FATHERS WERE FED EITHER A NC DIET OR CHALLENGED WITH AN OBESOGENIC WESTERN DIET (WD) FROM 12 WEEKS OF AGE. OFFSPRING BODY WEIGHT AND CARDIOMETABOLIC FUNCTION WERE ASSESSED, AND THE IMPACT OF TREATMENT OF PATERNAL CHOLESTASIS WITH UDCA WAS EVALUATED. RESULTS:: MALE OFFSPRING (18 WEEKS OLD) OF CHOLESTATIC FATHERS CHALLENGED WITH WD HAD RAISED FASTING INSULIN, HEPATIC TRIGLYCERIDE CONTENT AND SERUM CHOLESTEROL LEVELS COMPARED TO DIET-MATCHED CONTROLS. AT 2529 WEEKS OF AGE, WD-FED MALE OFFSPRING OF CHOLESTATIC FATHERS HAD HIGHER SYSTOLIC AND DIASTOLIC BLOOD PRESSURE THAN CONTROLS AND THIS WAS PREVENTED BY PATERNAL UDCA TREATMENT. IN CONTRAST, WD-CHALLENGED FEMALE OFFSPRING OF CHOLESTATIC FATHERS SHOWED IMPROVED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE COMPARED TO CONTROLS. CONCLUSIONS:: WE DEMONSTRATED IN OUR MODEL OF PATERNAL CHOLESTASIS THAT OFFSPRING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ADIPOSITY-ASSOCIATED CARDIOMETABOLIC DISEASE IS AFFECTED IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER AND PATERNAL UDCA TREATMENT HAD A PROTECTIVE EFFECT AGAINST HYPERTENSION IN THE OBESE MALE OFFSPRING. THE MOST PREVALENT HUMAN CHOLESTATIC CONDITIONS ARE PRIMARY SCLEROSING CHOLANGITIS AND PRIMARY BILIARY CHOLANGITIS.

USING AN ESTABLISHED MOUSE MODEL OF CHRONIC EXPOSURE, PREVIOUS WORK BY OUR GROUP HAS LINKED PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL ALCOHOL USE TO SEX-SPECIFIC PATTERNS OF FETAL GROWTH RESTRICTION AND PLACENTAL DYSFUNCTION. THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE LONG-TERM IMPACT OF CHRONIC PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL ALCOHOL USE ON OFFSPRING GROWTH AND METABOLIC PROGRAMMING. RESULTS: PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE INDUCED A PROLONGED PERIOD OF FETAL GESTATION AND AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF INTRAUTERINE GROWTH RESTRICTION, WHICH AFFECTED THE MALE OFFSPRING TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN THE FEMALES. WHILE THE FEMALE OFFSPRING OF ETHANOL-EXPOSED MALES WERE ABLE TO MATCH THE BODY WEIGHTS OF THE CONTROLS WITHIN THE FIRST 2 WEEKS OF POSTNATAL LIFE, MALE OFFSPRING CONTINUED TO DISPLAY AN 11% REDUCTION IN WEIGHT AT 5 WEEKS OF AGE AND A 6% REDUCTION AT 8 WEEKS OF AGE. THE OBSERVED GROWTH DEFICITS ASSOCIATED WITH INSULIN HYPERSENSITIVITY IN THE MALE OFFSPRING, WHILE IN CONTRAST, FEMALES DISPLAYED A MODEST LAG IN THEIR GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST. THESE METABOLIC DEFECTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH AN UP-REGULATION OF GENES WITHIN THE PRO-FIBROTIC TGF- SIGNALING PATHWAY AND INCREASED LEVELS OF CELLULAR HYDROXYPROLINE WITHIN THE LIVERS OF THE MALE OFFSPRING. WE OBSERVED SUPPRESSED CYTOKINE PROFILES WITHIN THE LIVER AND PANCREAS OF BOTH THE MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING, WHICH CORRELATED WITH THE UP-REGULATION OF GENES IN THE LIVERX/RETINOIDX/FARNESOIDX RECEPTOR PATHWAYS. HOWEVER, PATTERNS OF GENE EXPRESSION WERE HIGHLY VARIABLE BETWEEN THE OFFSPRING OF ALCOHOL-EXPOSED SIRES. IN THE ADULT OFFSPRING OF ALCOHOL-EXPOSED MALES, WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY DIFFERENCES IN THE ALLELIC EXPRESSION OF IGF2 OR ANY OTHER IMPRINTED GENES.

J. EPIDEMIOL.","RECENT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CERTAIN PHARMACOLOGICAL AGENTS USED BY FATHERS BEFORE CONCEPTION MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF ADVERSE NEONATAL OUTCOMES IN OFFSPRING. HOWEVER, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE EFFECT OF PATERNAL USE OF ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS (AEDS) ON CONGENITAL ANOMALIES IN CHILDREN. BASED ON DANISH NATIONAL REGISTERS, WE CONDUCTED A COHORT STUDY OF 733, 282 SINGLETONS BORN FROM 1997 TO 2008, WITH FOLLOW-UP THROUGHOUT 2013. THE CHILDREN WHOSE FATHERS USED AEDS DURING THE 3MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION WERE CATEGORIZED AS THE EXPOSED. LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO EXAMINE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATERNAL AEDS USE BEFORE CONCEPTION AND THE RISK OF CONGENITAL ANOMALIES IN OFFSPRING. COMPARED WITH UNEXPOSED CHILDREN, THE EXPOSED HAD A 23% INCREASED RISK OF CONGENITAL ANOMALIES (ODDS RATIOS (OR) 1.23, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI] 1.101.37) AFTER ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS. WHEN EXTENDING THE EXPOSURE WINDOW TO 1YEAR BEFORE CONCEPTION TO THE END OF PREGNANCY, EXCEPT FOR THOSE USING AEDS DURING 3MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION (THE SUSCEPTIBLE PERIOD OF EXPOSURE), THE INCREASED RISKS WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN CHILDREN WHOSE FATHERS WERE FORMER USERS (I.E., THOSE USING AEDS ONLY FROM 1YEAR TO 3MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION) (OR 1.29, 95%CI 1.031.61) AND LATER USERS (I.E., THOSE USING AEDS ONLY DURING PREGNANCY) (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.121.65). THIS STUDY SUGGESTED THAT THE MILDLY INCREASED RISK OF CONGENITAL ANOMALIES IN THE OFFSPRING ASSOCIATED WITH PATERNAL AEDS USE BEFORE CONCEPTION MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE UNDERLYING INDICATIONS RELATED TO AEDS USE. 2019, SPRINGER NATURE B.V.",NA,NA,"EJEPE","MIAO, M.; NHC KEY LABORATORY OF REPRODUCTION REGULATION, SHANGHAI INSTITUTE OF PLANNED PARENTHOOD RESEARCH, FUDAN UNIVERSITY, #779 LAO HU MIN ROAD, CHINA; EMAIL: MIAOMAOHUA@LIVE.COM","ARTICLE","10.1007/s10654-019-00509-2",NA,"03932990","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF EPIDEMIOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,NA,"SPRINGER NETHERLANDS","30868347","SCOPUS","PRECONCEPTIONAL PATERNAL ANTIEPILEPTIC DRUGS USE AND RISK OF CONGENITAL ANOMALIES IN OFFSPRING: A NATIONWIDE COHORT STUDY",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062917266&doi=10.1007%2fs10654-019-00509-2&partnerID=40&md5=083887ec5d505a028df257d8e3f7a299",NA,2019,"NA NA NA","FUDAN UNIVERSITY;AARHUS UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA;HARVARD T.

REDUCED REPRESENTATION BISULFITE SEQUENCING (RRBS) REVEALED DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED REGIONS (DMRS) IN ANNOTATED GENOMIC REGIONS IN SONS SIRED BEFORE (CONTROL) AND AFTER THE FATHERS TREATMENTS. WE DETECTED BOTH A HIGHLY SPECIFIC EPIGENETIC RESPONSE DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR THAT HAD CHANGED THAT WAS REFLECTED IN GENES INVOLVED IN SPECIFIC METABOLIC PATHWAYS, AND A MORE GENERAL RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN OUTER STIMULI REFLECTED BY EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS IN A SMALL SUBSET OF GENES SHARED BETWEEN BOTH RESPONSES. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT FATHERS PREPARED THEIR OFFSPRING FOR SPECIFIC ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES BY PATERNALLY INHERITED EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS, SUGGESTING A STRONG PATERNAL CONTRIBUTION TO ADAPTIVE PROCESSES. 2018 BY THE AUTHORS.

EXERCISE ONLY EARLY IN LIFE HAS A REMARKABLE EFFECT WITH RESPECT TO REPROGRAMMING ADULT RAT OFFSPRING EXPOSED TO DETRIMENTAL INSULTS BEFORE CONCEPTION. EXERCISE ONLY EARLY IN LIFE NORMALIZED ADULT WHOLE BODY AND MUSCLE INSULIN RESISTANCE AS A RESULT OF HAVING A HIGH-FAT FED/OBESE FATHER. UNLIKE THE EFFECTS ON THE MUSCLE, EARLY EXERCISE DID NOT NORMALIZE THE REDUCED ADULT PANCREATIC BETA CELL MASS AS A RESULT OF HAVING A HIGH-FAT FED/OBESE FATHER. EARLY-LIFE EXERCISE TRAINING MAY BE ABLE TO REPROGRAM AN INDIVIDUAL WHOSE FATHER WAS OBESE, INDUCING LONG-LASTING BENEFICIAL EFFECTS ON HEALTH. ABSTRACT: A PATERNAL HIGH-FAT DIET (HFD) IMPAIRS FEMALE RAT OFFSPRING GLUCOSE TOLERANCE, PANCREATIC MORPHOLOGY AND INSULIN SECRETION. WE EXAMINED WHETHER ONLY 4WEEKS OF EXERCISE EARLY IN LIFE COULD REPROGRAM THESE NEGATIVE EFFECTS. MALE SPRAGUEDAWLEY RATS CONSUMED A HFD FOR 10WEEKS BEFORE MATING WITH CHOW-FED DAMS. FEMALE OFFSPRING REMAINED SEDENTARY OR PERFORMED MODERATE INTENSITY TREADMILL EXERCISE (5DAYSWEEK 1 , 60MINDAY 1 , 20MMIN 1 ) FROM 5 TO 9WEEKS OF AGE. PATERNAL HFD IMPAIRED (P&LT; 0.05) ADULT OFFSPRING WHOLE BODY INSULIN SENSITIVITY (I.P. INSULIN SENSITIVITY TEST), AS WELL AS SKELETAL MUSCLE EX VIVO INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND TBC1D4 PHOSPHORYLATION. IT ALSO LOWERED -CELL MASS AND REDUCED IN VIVO INSULIN SECRETION IN RESPONSE TO AN I.P. GLUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST. EARLY-LIFE EXERCISE IN OFFSPRING REPROGRAMMED THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF A PATERNAL HFD ON WHOLE BODY INSULIN SENSITIVITY, SKELETAL MUSCLE EX VIVO INSULIN-STIMULATED GLUCOSE UPTAKE AND TBC1D4 PHOSPHORYLATION AND ALSO INCREASED GLUCOSE TRANSPORTER 4 PROTEIN. HOWEVER, EARLY EXERCISE DID NOT NORMALIZE THE REDUCED PANCREATIC -CELL MASS OR INSULIN SECRETION. IN CONCLUSION, ONLY 4WEEKS OF EXERCISE EARLY IN LIFE IN FEMALE RAT OFFSPRING REPROGRAMS REDUCTIONS IN INSULIN SENSITIVITY IN ADULTHOOD CAUSED BY A PATERNAL HFD WITHOUT AFFECTING PANCREATIC -CELL MASS OR INSULIN SECRETION. 2018 THE AUTHORS.

BIOPHYS. ACTA MOL. BASIS DIS.","OBJECTIVE: DIABETES EXERTS ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE INITIATION OR PROGRESSION OF DIABETES AND METABOLIC SYNDROME IN THE NEXT GENERATION. IN PAST STUDIES, LIMITED ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THE FATHERS' ROLE IN SHAPING THE METABOLIC LANDSCAPE OF OFFSPRING. OUR STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE HOW PATERNAL HYPERGLYCEMIA EXERTS AN INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECT IN MAMMALS AS WELL AS THE UNDERLYING MECHANISMS. METHODS: HYPERGLYCEMIA WAS INTRODUCED IN MALE RATS BY INTRAPERITONEALLY INJECTED STREPTOZOTOCIN AND THESE MALES WERE BRED WITH HEALTHY FEMALES TO GENERATE OFFSPRING. THE METABOLIC PROFILES OF THE PROGENY WERE ASSESSED; DNA METHYLATION PROFILES AND GENE EXPRESSION WERE INVESTIGATED. MUTAGENESIS CONSTRUCTS OF THE PPARA PROMOTER REGION, AND A LUCIFERASE REPORTER ASSAY WERE USED TO DETERMINE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR BINDING SITES (TFBSS) AND THE EFFECTS OF HYPERMETHYLATION ON PPARA TRANSCRIPTION. RESULTS: PATERNAL HYPERGLYCEMIA INDUCED INCREASED LIVER WEIGHT, AND PLASMA TC, TG, LDL, ACCUMULATION OF TRIGLYCERIDES IN THE LIVER. WE DISCOVERED THAT CPG 13 IN THE AMPLIFIED PROMOTER REGION (852 TO 601) OF PPARA WAS HYPERMETHYLATED IN ADULT OFFSPRING LIVER AND EXPRESSION OF PPARA, ACOX1, CPT-1, AND CD36 WAS DOWN REGULATED. HYPERMETHYLATION OF CPG SITE 13 IN THE PPARA PROMOTER INHIBITED THE GENE TRANSCRIPTION, PROBABLY THROUGH ABROGATION OF SP1 BINDING. THE SAME EPIGENETIC ALTERATION WAS DISCOVERED IN THE FETUS (E16.5) LIVER OF HYPERGLYCEMIC FATHER'S PROGENY. CONCLUSIONS: PATERNAL HYPERGLYCEMIA MAY INDUCE EPIGENETIC MODIFICATION OF PPARA IN OFFSPRING'S LIVER, PROBABLY THROUGH INTERACTION WITH SP1 BINDING, CAUSING IMPAIRED LIPID METABOLISM. OUR INVESTIGATION MAY HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF FATHER-OFFSPRING INTERACTIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ACCOUNT FOR METABOLIC SYNDROMES. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR ALPHA, 147258-70-6; STREPTOZOCIN, 18883-66-4","BBADE","XIAO, X.; DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, THE FIRST AFFILIATED HOSPITAL OF CHONGQING MEDICAL UNIVERSITYCHINA; EMAIL: BSHAW2001@163.COM","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.bbadis.2018.10.040","NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM)NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM),2012CB517505 CHONGQING BASIC SCIENCE AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAMCHONGQING BASIC SCIENCE AND ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH PROGRAM,CSTC 2015JCYJB0146 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA,81270947,81871222,81570763","09254439","BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA - MOLECULAR BASIS OF DISEASE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,1,"1",NA,"147-160","ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"SCOPUS","PATERNAL HYPERGLYCEMIA INDUCES TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE OF SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HEPATIC STEATOSIS IN RATS INVOLVING ALTERED METHYLATION ON PPAR PROMOTER",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056153938&doi=10.1016%2fj.bbadis.2018.10.040&partnerID=40&md5=bf33003ecd4f6c601e1f2cb3f1f5ba25","1865",2019,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY GRANTS FROM THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA ( 81871222 , 81570763 AND 81270947 ), THE NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA ( 2012CB517505 ) AND THE FUNDAMENTAL SCIENCE & ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH OF CHONGQING (MAJOR PROJECT, CSTC 2015JCYJB0146 ) TO XIAOQIU XIAO.

ALTHOUGH EXERCISE IN THE GENERAL POPULATION IS KNOWN TO IMPROVE HEALTH, THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL EXERCISE ON SPERM AND OFFSPRING METABOLIC HEALTH ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN. HERE, WE STUDIED 7-WEEK-OLD C57BL/6 MALE MICE FED A CHOW OR HIGH-FAT DIET AND HOUSED EITHER IN STATIC CAGES (SEDENTARY) OR CAGES WITH ATTACHED RUNNING WHEELS (EXERCISE TRAINED). AFTER 3 WEEKS, ONE COHORT OF MALES WAS SACRIFICED AND CAUDA SPERM OBTAINED, WHILE THE OTHER COHORT WAS BRED WITH CHOW-FED SEDENTARY C57BL/6 FEMALES. OFFSPRING WERE CHOW FED, SEDENTARY, AND STUDIED DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF LIFE. WE FOUND THAT HIGH-FAT FEEDING OF SIRES IMPAIRS GLUCOSE TOLERANCE AND INCREASES THE PERCENTAGE OF FAT MASS IN BOTH MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING AT 52 WEEKS OF AGE. STRIKINGLY, PATERNAL EXERCISE SUPPRESSES THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL HIGH-FAT DIET ON OFFSPRING, REVERSING THE OBSERVED IMPAIRMENT IN GLUCOSE TOLERANCE, PERCENTAGE OF FAT MASS, AND GLUCOSE UPTAKE IN SKELETAL MUSCLES OF THE OFFSPRING. THESE CHANGES IN OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE ARE ACCOMPANIED BY CHANGES IN SPERM PHYSIOLOGY, AS, FOR EXAMPLE, HIGH-FAT FEEDING RESULTS IN DECREASED SPERM MOTILITY, AN EFFECT NORMALIZED IN MALES SUBJECT TO EXERCISE TRAINING. DEEP SEQUENCING OF SPERM REVEALS PRONOUNCED EFFECTS OF EXERCISE TRAINING ON MULTIPLE CLASSES OF SMALL RNAS, AS MULTIPLE CHANGES TO THE SPERM RNA PAYLOAD OBSERVED IN ANIMALS CONSUMING A HIGH-FAT DIET ARE SUPPRESSED BY EXERCISE TRAINING. THUS, VOLUNTARY EXERCISE TRAINING OF MALE MICE RESULTS IN PRONOUNCED IMPROVEMENTS IN THE METABOLIC HEALTH OF ADULT MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING. WE PROVIDE THE FIRST IN-DEPTH ANALYSIS OF SMALL RNAS IN SPERM FROM EXERCISE-TRAINED MALES, REVEALING A MARKED CHANGE IN THE LEVELS OF MULTIPLE SMALL RNAS WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ALTER PHENOTYPES IN THE NEXT GENERATION. 2018 BY THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION.

PSYCHOBIOL.","THE EFFECTS OF EARLY STRESS MAY NOT BE LIMITED TO THE EXPOSED GENERATION, BUT ARE SOMETIMES PASSED ON TO SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS. SUCH NON-GENETIC TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE IS A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTAL AND EVOLUTIONARY FORCE. WE COMPARED THE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL LINE EARLY STRESS ON ANXIETY- AND HEALTH-RELATED TRAITS IN THREE NON-EXPOSED GENERATIONS (F1, F2 AND F3) OF SEMI-NATURALISTICALLY RAISED RHESUS MACAQUES. AS INFANTS, F0 MACAQUES WERE EXPOSED TO NURSERY REARING (NR) OR SEMI-NATURALISTIC SOCIAL CONDITIONS (CONTROL). THREE HUNDRED FORTY NON-EXPOSED F1F3 DESCENDANTS WERE CONTROL REARED AND PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL MEASURES WERE COLLECTED DURING STANDARDIZED ASSESSMENT AT 34MONTHS OF AGE. PATERNAL LINE NR WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER NERVOUSNESS IN F1F3 AND LOWER IMMUNE CELL COUNTS IN F1F2. MATERNAL-LINE NR EFFECTS WERE NOT OBSERVED.

THE ECOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS OF MACROPLASTICS POLLUTION ARE WELL DOCUMENTED, BUT LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT NANOPLASTICS. THE CURRENT STUDY INVESTIGATES THE POTENTIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS OF NANOPLASTICS, WHICH LIKELY CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECOLOGICAL BURDEN OF PLASTIC POLLUTION. TO THIS END, WE EXAMINED WHETHER A DIETARY EXPOSURE OF ADULT ZEBRAFISH (DANIO RERIO) TO POLYSTYRENE NANOPARTICLES (PS NPS) COULD LEAD TO THE TRANSFER OF NANOPLASTICS TO THE OFFSPRING, AND WHETHER NANOPLASTICS EXPOSURE AFFECTS ZEBRAFISH PHYSIOLOGY. SPECIFICALLY, ADULT FEMALE AND MALE ZEBRAFISH (F0 GENERATION) WERE EXPOSED TO PS NPS VIA DIET FOR ONE WEEK AND BRED TO PRODUCE THE F1 GENERATION. FOUR F1 GROUPS WERE GENERATED: CONTROL (UNEXPOSED FEMALES AND MALES), MATERNAL (EXPOSED FEMALES), PATERNAL (EXPOSED MALES), AND CO-PARENTAL (EXPOSED MALES AND FEMALES). CO-PARENTAL PS NP EXPOSURE DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. ASSESSMENT OF TISSUES FROM F0 FISH REVEALED THAT EXPOSURE TO PS NPS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE ACTIVITY IN BRAIN, MUSCLE, AND TESTES, BUT DID NOT AFFECT MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION PARAMETERS IN HEART OR GONADS. ASSESSMENT OF F1 EMBRYOS AND LARVAE REVEALED THAT PS NPS WERE PRESENT IN THE YOLK SAC, GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT, LIVER, AND PANCREAS OF THE MATERNALLY AND CO-PARENTALLY EXPOSED F1 EMBRYOS/LARVAE. BRADYCARDIA WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN EMBRYOS FROM MATERNAL AND CO-PARENTAL EXPOSURE GROUPS. IN ADDITION, THE ACTIVITY OF GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE AND THE LEVELS OF THIOLS WERE REDUCED IN F1 EMBRYOS/LARVAE FROM MATERNAL AND/OR CO-PARENTAL EXPOSURE GROUPS. MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION AND LOCOMOTOR ACTIVITY WERE NOT AFFECTED IN F1 LARVAE. THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT (I) PS NPS ARE TRANSFERRED FROM MOTHERS TO OFFSPRING, AND (II) EXPOSURE TO PS NPS MODIFIES THE ANTIOXIDANT SYSTEM IN ADULT TISSUES AND F1 LARVAE. WE CONCLUDE THAT PS NPS COULD BIOACCUMULATE AND BE PASSED ON TO THE OFFSPRING, BUT THIS DOES NOT LEAD TO MAJOR PHYSIOLOGICAL DISTURBANCES. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"GLUTATHIONE REDUCTASE, 9001-48-3; POLYSTYRENE, 9003-53-6; POLYSTYRENES; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL","STEVA","TREVISAN, R.; NICHOLAS SCHOOL OF THE ENVIRONMENT, DUKE UNIVERSITYUNITED STATES; EMAIL: RAFAEL.TREVISAN@DUKE.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.186","T32-ES021432 P42-ES010356 CENTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF NANOTECHNOLOGYCENTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPLICATIONS OF NANOTECHNOLOGY,NSF 3331894","00489697","SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT","ENGLISH",NA,NA,5,NA,NA,"324-334","ELSEVIER B.V.","29940444","SCOPUS","MATERNAL TRANSFER OF NANOPLASTICS TO OFFSPRING IN ZEBRAFISH (DANIO RERIO): A CASE STUDY WITH NANOPOLYSTYRENE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048769746&doi=10.1016%2fj.scitotenv.2018.06.186&partnerID=40&md5=19b1310bcb99070289fa2e798226a340","643",2018,"WE THANK ALL MEMBERS OF THE DI GIULIO LABORATORY FOR HELP WITH ZEBRAFISH HUSBANDRY.

BEING EFFECTIVE AGAINST PESTS, IT IS ALSO KNOWN TO HAVE LETHAL AND SUBLETHAL EFFECTS ON NON-TARGET ORGANISMS. WHILE CONSIDERABLE RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THE IMPACT OF IVERMECTIN RESIDUES IN LIVESTOCK DUNG ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND SURVIVAL OF DUNG FEEDING INSECT LARVAE, SURPRISINGLY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT ITS FITNESS EFFECTS ON ADULTS. WE TESTED THE IMPACT OF IVERMECTIN ON THE SURVIVAL OF ADULT SEPSID DUNG FLY SPECIES (DIPTERA: SEPSIDAE) IN THE LABORATORY, USING AN ECOLOGICALLY RELEVANT AND REALISTIC RANGE OF 691978 G IVERMECTIN/KG WET DUNG, AND COMPARED THE SENSITIVITIES OF LARVAE AND ADULTS IN A PHYLOGENETIC FRAMEWORK. FOR ONE REPRESENTATIVE, RELATIVELY INSENSITIVE SPECIES, SEPSIS PUNCTUM, WE FURTHER INVESTIGATED EFFECTS OF IVERMECTIN ON FEMALE FECUNDITY AND MALE FERTILITY. MOREOVER, WE TESTED WHETHER FEMALES CAN DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN IVERMECTIN-SPIKED AND NON-CONTAMINATED DUNG IN THE WILD. ADULT SEPSID FLIES EXPOSED TO IVERMECTIN SUFFERED INCREASED MORTALITY, WHEREBY CLOSELY RELATED SPECIES VARIED STRONGLY IN THEIR SENSITIVITY.

METHODS: MALE MICE (F0) WERE RANDOMIZED TO RECEIVE EITHER A CONTROL DIET (10 KCAL% FAT) OR A HIGH-FAT DIET (HFD; 60 KCAL% FAT) FOR 10 WEEKS BEFORE BEING MATED WITH NORMAL FEMALES TO GENERATE F1 OFFSPRING. MALE F1 OFFSPRING WERE MATED WITH NORMAL FEMALES TO GENERATE F2 OFFSPRING. BEHAVIORAL TESTS WERE USED TO ASSESS COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN F1 AND F2 OFFSPRING. REDUCED REPRESENTATION BISULFITE SEQUENCING WAS USED TO THE EXPLORE MECHANISMS OF EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE. RESULTS: HFD-INDUCED PATERNAL OBESITY RESULTED IN COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN F1 OFFSPRING, POTENTIALLY DUE, AT LEAST IN PART, TO INCREASED METHYLATION OF THE BDNF GENE PROMOTER, WHICH WAS INHERITED FROM F0 SPERMATOZOA. BDNF/TYROSINE RECEPTOR KINASE B SIGNALING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN HFD-FED F1 OFFSPRING. HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN F2 OFFSPRING.

REPROD.","PRETERM BIRTH (PTB), PARTURITION PRIOR TO 37 WEEKS' GESTATION, IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF NEONATAL MORTALITY. THE CAUSES OF SPONTANEOUS PTB ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD; HOWEVER, RECENT STUDIES SUGGEST THAT THIS CONDITION MAY ARISE AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE PARENTAL FETAL ENVIRONMENT. SPECIFICALLY, WE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED THAT DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE OF MALE MICE (F1 ANIMALS) TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED SPERM QUANTITY/QUALITY IN ADULTHOOD AND CONTROL FEMALE PARTNERS FREQUENTLY DELIVERED PRETERM. REPRODUCTIVE DEFECTS PERSISTED IN THE F2 AND F3 DESCENDANTS, AND SPONTANEOUS PTB WAS COMMON. REPRODUCTIVE CHANGES IN THE F3 MALES, THE FIRST GENERATION WITHOUT DIRECT TCDD EXPOSURE, SUGGEST THE OCCURRENCE OF EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS IN THE SPERM, WHICH HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT PLACENTAL DEVELOPMENT. HEREIN, WE CONDUCTED AN EPIGENETIC MICROARRAY ANALYSIS OF CONTROL AND F1 MALE-DERIVED PLACENTAE, WHICH IDENTIFIED 2171 DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED REGIONS, INCLUDING THE PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (PGR) AND INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR (IGF2). TO ASSESS IF PGR AND IGF2 DNA METHYLATION CHANGES WERE PRESENT IN SPERM AND PERSIST IN FUTURE GENERATIONS, WE ASSESSED METHYLATION AND EXPRESSION OF THESE GENES IN F1/F3 SPERM AND F3-DERIVED PLACENTAE. ALTHOUGH ALTERATIONS IN METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION WERE OBSERVED, IN MOST TISSUES, ONLY PGR REACHED STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. DESPITE THE MODEST GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES IN IGF2, OFFSPRING OF F1 AND F3 MALES CONSISTENTLY EXHIBITED IUGR. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR DATA INDICATE THAT PATERNAL DEVELOPMENTAL TCDD EXPOSURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSGENERATIONAL PLACENTAL DYSFUNCTION, SUGGESTING EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS WITHIN THE SPERM HAVE OCCURRED.

GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF LARVAL NUTRITION IN INFLUENCING ADULT LIFE HISTORIES AND VECTOR COMPETENCE IN AEDES AEGYPTI, WE CONSIDERED HOW MATERNAL AND PATERNAL NUTRITION INFLUENCES OFFSPRING. PARENTAL GENERATION FEMALES AND MALES WERE REARED ON EITHER HIGH OR LOW LARVAL FOOD AND MATED IN FOUR SEX-BY-PARENTAL DIET CROSSES. OFFSPRING TRAITS MEASURED INCLUDED DEVELOPMENT TIME, SURVIVORSHIP, FEMALE SIZE, SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTION WITH DENGUE VIRUS, VIRAL TITER, AND VIRAL DISSEMINATION. WE FOUND EVIDENCE FOR BOTH MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EFFECTS ON LIFE HISTORY TRAITS (WITH FEMALE DEVELOPMENT TIME CONTRIBUTING MOST TO THIS EFFECT), BUT NOT VIRAL TRAITS. THESE RESULTS WERE ONLY EVIDENT WHEN MOTHERS MATED WITH HIGH LARVAL FOOD FATHERS AND WHEN FATHERS MATED WITH HIGH LARVAL FOOD MOTHERS. OFFSPRING FROM DISSIMILAR NUTRIENT CONDITION PARENTS DEVELOPED MORE QUICKLY THAN OFFSPRING FROM OTHER PARENTAL CROSSES. OVERALL, RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PARENTAL EFFECTS IN AE.AEGYPTI ARE CONDITIONALLY DERIVED FROM BOTH THE MATERNAL AND PATERNAL ENVIRONMENT. 2018 THE AUTHORS.","E02469",NA,NA,"ZIRBEL, K.E.; FLORIDA MEDICAL ENTOMOLOGY LABORATORY, ENTOMOLOGY AND NEMATOLOGY DEPARTMENT, INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDAUNITED STATES; EMAIL: ZIRBELKE@UFL.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1002/ecs2.2469","UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDAUNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","21508925","ECOSPHERE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,0,"10",NA,NA,"WILEY-BLACKWELL",NA,"SCOPUS","MATERNAL AND PATERNAL NUTRITION IN A MOSQUITO INFLUENCES OFFSPRING LIFE HISTORIES BUT NOT INFECTION WITH AN ARBOVIRUS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055623149&doi=10.1002%2fecs2.2469&partnerID=40&md5=aef297ff4f8c606c085860e4d7c64642","9",2018,"DENGUE-1 VIRUS (STRAIN BOL-KW010) WAS KINDLY PROVIDED BY THE FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH BUREAU OF LABORATORIES.

HERE, THE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE TO STRANDED HEAVY FUEL OIL (HFO) ON THE SEA URCHIN STRONGYLOCENTROTUS INTERMEDIUS WERE ASSESSED. THE COLUMN CONTAINING GRAVEL COATED WITH HFO WAS PREPARED IN THE LABORATORY TO SIMULATE HFO-CONTAMINATED GRAVEL SHORELINES. ADULT SEA URCHINS WERE EXPOSED FOR 21 DAYS TO EITHER A HFO-OILED GRAVEL COLUMN AT THE OIL LOADING OF 3000 G OIL/G GRAVEL OR A NON-HFO-OILED GRAVEL COLUMN (AS THE CONTROL TREATMENT) AND THEN OFFSPRING WERE EITHER EXPOSED TO HFO OR AMBIENT SEAWATER CONDITIONS. THE SUBLETHAL EXPOSURE TO HFO FOR 21 DAYS INDUCED POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC HYDROCARBONS (PAHS) ACCUMULATION IN GONADS, ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASED LEVELS OF OXIDATIVE LIPID, PROTEIN AND DNA DAMAGE AND A REDUCTION IN TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY. ANALYSIS OF GAMETES INDICATED THAT BOTH MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EXPOSURE COULD RESULT IN THE TRANSFER OF PAHS AND DNA DAMAGE TO THEIR OFFSPRING. PARENTAL (MATERNAL, PATERNAL OR BOTH) EXPOSURE TO HFO CAUSED INCREASES IN MALFORMATION RATES OF OFFSPRING COMPARED TO THOSE FROM CONTROL PARENTS UNDER AMBIENT SEAWATER CONDITION. CONTINUED HFO EXPOSURE IN THE OFFSPRING RESULTED IN FURTHER INCREASED MALFORMATION RATES COMPARED WITH THOSE REARED IN AMBIENT SEAWATER, AS WELL AS OXIDATIVE LIPID, PROTEIN AND DNA DAMAGE. FURTHERMORE, MOTHER EXPOSURE HISTORY REDUCED THE TOTAL ANTIOXIDANT CAPACITY OF LARVAE TO RESPONSE TO CONTINUED HFO EXPOSURE. OVERALL, THE RESULTS SUGGEST AN INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO TOXIC EFFECTS OF HFO IN LARVAE FROM EXPOSED BOTH PARENTS COMPARED WITH THOSE FROM CONTROL PARENTS IN S. INTERMEDIUS, WHICH MAY CONSEQUENTLY AFFECT THE RECRUITMENT AND POPULATION MAINTENANCE. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"LIPID, 66455-18-3; PROTEIN, 67254-75-5","MERSD","XIONG, D.; SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, DALIAN MARITIME UNIVERSITY, LINGHAI ROAD 1, CHINA; EMAIL: XIONGDQ@DLMU.EDU.CN","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.marenvres.2018.08.010","NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA,51479016,41276105,40976064","01411136","MARINE ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH","ENGLISH",NA,NA,0,NA,NA,"138-147","ELSEVIER LTD","30177415","SCOPUS","TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF HEAVY FUEL OIL ON THE SEA URCHIN STRONGYLOCENTROTUS INTERMEDIUS CONSIDERING OXIDATIVE STRESS BIOMARKERS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052734410&doi=10.1016%2fj.marenvres.2018.08.010&partnerID=40&md5=c08fbf2d7d44306bf8c4444bbdbaa8d5","141",2018,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA ( 40976064 , 41276105 AND 51479016 ).

THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL STRESS (PPS) ON CEREBRAL PLASTICITY AND BEHAVIOR IN THE OFFSPRING. SEVERAL BEHAVIORAL ASSAYS WERE PERFORMED ON OFFSPRING BETWEEN POSTNATAL DAYS 33 (P33) AND 101 (P101). FOLLOWING BEHAVIORAL TESTING, THE BRAINS WERE HARVESTED AND DENDRITIC MORPHOLOGY (DENDRITIC COMPLEXITY, LENGTH, AND SPINE DENSITY) WERE EXAMINED ON CORTICAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS IN MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (MPFC), ORBITAL FRONTAL CORTEX (OFC), PARIETAL CORTEX (PAR1), AND THE CA1 AREA OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS. AS ANTICIPATED, BEHAVIOR WAS ALTERED ON BOTH THE ACTIVITY BOX ASSAY AND ELEVATED PLUS MAZE AND PERFORMANCE WAS IMPAIRED IN THE WHISHAW TRAY REACHING TASK. NEUROANATOMICAL MEASURES REVEALED A HEAVIER BRAIN IN STRESSED ANIMALS AND DENDRITIC CHANGES IN ALL REGIONS MEASURED, THE PRECISE EFFECT VARYING WITH THE MEASURE AND CEREBRAL REGION.

SAF.","THE PRESENT STUDY INVESTIGATED THE TOXIC EFFECTS OF PARENTAL (MATERNAL/PATERNAL) EXPOSURE TO HEAVY FUEL OIL (HFO) ON THE ADULT REPRODUCTIVE STATE, GAMETE QUALITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFSPRING OF THE SEA URCHIN STRONGYLOCENTROTUS INTERMEDIUS. ADULT SEA URCHINS WERE EXPOSED TO EFFLUENTS FROM HFO-OILED GRAVEL COLUMNS FOR 7 DAYS TO SIMULATE AN OIL-CONTAMINATED GRAVEL SHORE, AND THEN GAMETES OF ADULT SEA URCHINS WERE USED TO PRODUCE EMBRYOS TO DETERMINE DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY. FOR ADULT SEA URCHINS, NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN THE SOMATIC SIZE AND WEIGHT WAS FOUND BETWEEN THE VARIOUS OIL LOADINGS TESTED, WHILE THE GONAD WEIGHT AND GONAD INDEX WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AT HIGHER OIL LOADINGS. THE SPAWNING ABILITY OF ADULTS AND FECUNDITY OF FEMALES SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED. FOR GAMETES, NO EFFECT WAS OBSERVED ON THE EGG SIZE AND FERTILIZATION SUCCESS IN ANY OF THE GROUPS. HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF ANOMALIES IN THE OFFSPRING WAS OBSERVED AND THEN QUANTIFIED BY AN INTEGRATIVE TOXICITY INDEX (ITI) AT 24 AND 48 H POST FERTILIZATION. THE OFFSPRING FROM EXPOSED PARENTS SHOWED HIGHER ITI VALUES WITH MORE MALFORMED EMBRYOS. THE RESULTS CONFIRMED THAT PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO HFO CAN CAUSE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE OFFSPRING AND CONSEQUENTLY AFFECT THE RECRUITMENT AND POPULATION MAINTENANCE OF SEA URCHINS. 2018 ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"FUEL OILS","EESAD","XIONG, D.; SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, DALIAN MARITIME UNIVERSITY, LINGHAI ROAD 1, CHINA; EMAIL: XIONGDQ@DLMU.EDU.CN","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.ecoenv.2018.04.067","NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA,51479016,40976064 41276105","01476513","ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,4,NA,NA,"109-119","ACADEMIC PRESS","29730404","SCOPUS","PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO HEAVY FUEL OIL INDUCES DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY IN OFFSPRING OF THE SEA URCHIN STRONGYLOCENTROTUS INTERMEDIUS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046495945&doi=10.1016%2fj.ecoenv.2018.04.067&partnerID=40&md5=2e68819aaef8cda8ec756f1180e6adbf","159",2018,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA ( 40976064 41276105 AND 51479016 ).

ROSUVASTATIN REDUCES SERUM CHOLESTEROL; HOWEVER, SEVERAL STUDIES ASSOCIATED STATIN EXPOSURE WITH MALE REPRODUCTION IMPAIRMENT. ASCORBIC ACID (AA) IS AN ANTIOXIDANT SUBSTANCE THAT PLAYS A PROTECTIVE ROLE IN THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. MALE RATS WERE RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO 6 EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS (N=10), WHICH RECEIVED SALINE SOLUTION 0.9%, 3 OR 10MG/KG/DAY OF ROSUVASTATIN, 150MG/DAY OF AA OR 3 OR 10MG/KG/DAY OF ROSUVASTATIN ASSOCIATED WITH 150MG/DAY OF AA FROM POST-NATAL DAY (PND) 23 UNTIL PND 53. ON PND 100, MALES WERE MATED WITH NON-TREATED FEMALE RATS TO OBTAIN THE FEMALE PUPS. THE DAY OF VAGINAL OPENING AND THE FIRST ESTRUS WERE ASSESSED IN THE OFFSPRING. TWO SETS OF FEMALES WERE EUTHANIZED ON THE FIRST ESTRUS AFTER PND 42 AND PND 75 TO EVALUATE THE HISTOLOGY OF REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND HORMONE LEVELS. A THIRD SET WAS USED FOR SEXUAL BEHAVIOR AND FERTILITY TEST AROUND PND 75. FEMALE OFFSPRING FROM MALES EXPOSED OR CO-EXPOSED TO THE HIGHER DOSE OF STATINEXHIBITED A LOWER NUMBER OF CORPORA LUTEA DURING PUBERTY. ON SEXUAL MATURITY, THE EXPERIMENTAL GROUP FROM MALES THAT WERE EXPOSED TO 3MG DISPLAYED LOWER UTERINE LUMINAL EPITHELIUM AREA. PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO ROSUVASTATIN AT PRE-PUBERTY DIMINISHED UTERINE LUMINAL EPITHELIUM IN FEMALE OFFSPRING SUGGESTING EPIGENETIC CHANGES WERE INITIATED BY STATIN.

POPULATION STUDIES GENERALLY SHOW A U-SHAPED ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BIRTHWEIGHT AND BREAST CANCER RISK, WITH BOTH HIGH AND LOW BIRTHWEIGHT INCREASING THE RISK COMPARED WITH AVERAGE BIRTHWEIGHT. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER PATERNAL MALNUTRITION WOULD MODULATE THE BIRTHWEIGHT AND LATER BREAST CANCER RISK OF DAUGHTERS. METHODS: MALE MICE WERE FED AIN93G-BASED DIETS CONTAINING EITHER 17.7% (CONTROL) OR 8.9% (LOW-PROTEIN (LP)) ENERGY FROM PROTEIN FROM 3 TO 10 WEEKS OF AGE. MALES ON EITHER GROUP WERE MATED TO FEMALES RAISED ON A CONTROL DIET. FEMALE OFFSPRING FROM CONTROL AND LP FATHERS WERE TREATED WITH 7,12-DIMETHYLBENZ[A]ANTHRACENE (DMBA) TO INITIATE MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS. MATURE SPERM FROM FATHERS AND MAMMARY TISSUE AND TUMORS FROM FEMALE OFFSPRING WERE USED FOR EPIGENETIC AND OTHER MOLECULAR ANALYSES. RESULTS: WE FOUND THAT PATERNAL MALNUTRITION REDUCES THE BIRTHWEIGHT OF DAUGHTERS AND LEADS TO EPIGENETIC AND METABOLIC REPROGRAMMING OF THEIR MAMMARY TISSUE AND TUMORS. DAUGHTERS OF LP FATHERS HAVE HIGHER RATES OF MAMMARY CANCER, WITH TUMORS ARISING EARLIER AND GROWING FASTER THAN IN CONTROLS. THE ENERGY SENSOR, THE AMP-ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE (AMPK) PATHWAY, IS SUPPRESSED IN BOTH MAMMARY GLANDS AND TUMORS OF LP DAUGHTERS, WITH CONSEQUENT ACTIVATION OF MAMMALIAN TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (MTOR) SIGNALING. FURTHERMORE, LP MAMMARY TUMORS SHOW ALTERED AMINO-ACID METABOLISM WITH INCREASED GLUTAMINE UTILIZATION. THESE CHANGES ARE LINKED TO ALTERATIONS IN NONCODING RNAS REGULATING THOSE PATHWAYS IN MAMMARY GLANDS AND TUMORS. IMPORTANTLY, WE DETECT ALTERATIONS IN SOME OF THE SAME MICRORNAS/TARGET GENES FOUND IN OUR ANIMAL MODEL IN BREAST TUMORS OF WOMEN FROM POPULATIONS WHERE LOW BIRTHWEIGHT IS PREVALENT. CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT ANCESTRAL PATERNAL MALNUTRITION PLAYS A ROLE IN PROGRAMMING OFFSPRING CANCER RISK AND PHENOTYPE BY LIKELY PROVIDING A METABOLIC ADVANTAGE TO CANCER CELLS. 2018 THE AUTHOR(S).","99","DIMETHYLBENZ[A]ANTHRACENE, 43178-07-0; GLUTAMINE, 56-85-9, 6899-04-3; HYDROXYMETHYLGLUTARYL COENZYME A REDUCTASE KINASE, 172522-01-9, 72060-32-3; 3-(2,6-BIS(4-FLUOROPHENYL)-3-METHYLPIPERIDIN-4-YLIDENEAMINO)-2-THIOXOIMIDAZOLIDIN-4-ONE ON 7,12-DIMETHYLBENZ(A)ANTHRACENE; ANTHRACENES; MICRORNAS; PIPERIDINES","BCRRC","DE ASSIS, S.; GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY, DEPARTMENT OF ONCOLOGY, LOMBARDI COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER, 3970 RESERVOIR ROAD, NW, THE RESEARCH BUILDING, ROOM E410, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: DEASSISS@GEORGETOWN.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1186/s13058-018-1034-7","NATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCESNATIONAL CENTER FOR ADVANCING TRANSLATIONAL SCIENCES,TL1TR001431 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,1P30-CA51008 AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETYAMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY PREVENT CANCER FOUNDATIONPREVENT CANCER FOUNDATION,299045 GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITYGEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY,2016-1172 FOUNDATION FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHFOUNDATION FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH","14655411","BREAST CANCER RESEARCH","ENGLISH",NA,NA,1,"1",NA,NA,"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.","30165877","SCOPUS","PATERNAL MALNUTRITION PROGRAMS BREAST CANCER RISK AND TUMOR METABOLISM IN OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052598565&doi=10.1186%2fs13058-018-1034-7&partnerID=40&md5=2575ad15e0aaf8c69adde77aa3f8b066","20",2018,"THIS STUDY WAS SUPPORTED IN PART BY THE PREVENT CANCER FOUNDATION (RESEARCH GRANT #299045 TO SDA), THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY (RESEARCH SCHOLAR GRANT TO SDA), THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (1P30-CA51008; LOMBARDI COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTER SUPPORT GRANT TO L.

WE DESIGNED A COHORT STUDY TO INVESTIGATE THE RELATION BETWEEN LIFESTYLE AND ASSISTED REPRODUCTION TECHNIQUE (ART) OUTCOMES. FROM SEPTEMBER 2014 TO DECEMBER 2016, 339 SUBFERTILE COUPLES REFERRING TO AN ITALIAN FERTILITY CLINIC AND ELIGIBLE FOR ART PROCEDURES WERE ENROLLED IN OUR STUDY. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, SMOKING, AND USUAL ALCOHOL AND CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO ART WERE RECORDED. THE MEAN AGE OF PARTICIPANTS WAS 36.6 3.6 YEARS IN WOMEN AND 39.4 5.2 YEARS IN MEN. AFTER OOCYTES RETRIEVAL, 293 (86.4%) UNDERWENT IMPLANTATION, 110 (32.4%) ACHIEVED CLINICAL PREGNANCY, AND 82 (24.2%) LIVE BIRTH. MATERNAL AGE WAS THE MAIN DETERMINANT OF ART OUTCOME. IN A MODEL INCLUDING WOMENS AGE AND COLLEGE DEGREE, SMOKING HABITS, CALORIE AND ALCOHOL INTAKE FOR BOTH PARTNERS, PREVIOUS ART CYCLES, AND PARTNERS CAFFEINE INTAKE, WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CAFFEINE INTAKE AND ART OUTCOME. USING THE FIRST TERTILE OF CAFFEINE INTAKE BY WOMEN AS A REFERENCE, THE ADJUSTED RATE RATIO (ARR) FOR LIVE BIRTH WAS 1.09 (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 0.791.50) IN THE SECOND AND 0.99 (95% CI 0.711.40) IN THE THIRD TERTILES.

BRAIN RES.","MATERNAL EXERCISE IS KNOWN TO HAVE BENEFICIAL EFFECTS IN PROGENY DEVELOPMENT, BUT THE INFLUENCE OF PATERNAL EXERCISE ON THE OFFSPRING STILL UNCLEAR. SINCE SPERMATOGENESIS IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, THE FATHER'S LIFE EXPERIENCES CAN REPROGRAM EPIGENETIC CONTENT OF THE SPERM AND SOMEHOW INTERFERE ON OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE. THIS STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT AND ON HIPPOCAMPAL DNA METHYLATION LEVELS OF THE OFFSPRING. ADULT MALE WISTAR RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS: SEDENTARY AND EXERCISED. THE EXERCISE PROTOCOL OCCURRED BEFORE MATING AND CONSISTED OF TREADMILL RUNNING, 5 CONSECUTIVE DAYS/WEEK FOR 8 WEEKS (20 MIN/DAY). THE MOTHERS WERE NOT TRAINED. THE FOLLOWING DEVELOPMENTAL PARAMETERS WERE EXAMINED IN MALE OFFSPRING: BODY GROWTH, PHYSICAL AND COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE, WEIGHTS OF ADRENAL GLANDS, GONADAL FAT AND HINDLIMB MUSCLES, BDNF EXPRESSION AND GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION AT THE HIPPOCAMPUS. THE PROGENY OF TRAINED AND SEDENTARY FATHERS DID NOT DIFFER IN RELATION TO PHYSICAL PARAMETERS AND PERFORMANCE, SPATIAL MEMORY AND BDNF EXPRESSION. HOWEVER, PATERNAL EXERCISE PROMOTED A DECREASE IN OFFSPRINGS RELATIVE GONADAL FAT WEIGHT AND A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF GLOBAL HIPPOCAMPAL DNA METHYLATION COMPARED TO OFFSPRING OF SEDENTARY FATHERS. THESE RESULTS POINTED TO INTERFERENCE OF MALE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION ON ADIPOSITY AND HIPPOCAMPAL EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING OF MALE OFFSPRING. THE DATA REINFORCES THAT EXERCISE DOES NOT HARM THE DESCENDANT'S DEVELOPMENT AND EMPHASIZE THE BENEFITS TO INCLUDE THE PRACTICE OF PHYSICAL EXERCISE IN A HEALTHIER LIFESTYLE OF THE PARENTS. NEVERTHELESS, FUTURE STUDIES ARE NECESSARY AND SHOULD INVESTIGATE FURTHER THE LONG-EFFECTS OF EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS IN ORDER TO ELUCIDATE THE FATHER'S CONTRIBUTION IN FETAL PROGRAMMING. 2018 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR, 218441-99-7","BBRED","MARCUZZO, S.; PROGRAMA DE PS-GRADUAO EM NEUROCINCIAS, INSTITUTO DE CINCIAS BSICAS DA SADE, UNIVERSIDADE FEDERAL DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL, RUA SARMENTO LEITE 500, CEP: 90050-170 PORTO ALEGRE, BRAZIL; EMAIL: SIMONE.MARCUZZO@UFRGS.BR","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.bbr.2018.03.040","CONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTFICO E TECNOLGICOCONSELHO NACIONAL DE DESENVOLVIMENTO CIENTFICO E TECNOLGICO COORDENAO DE APERFEIOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NVEL SUPERIORCOORDENAO DE APERFEIOAMENTO DE PESSOAL DE NVEL SUPERIOR FUNDAO DE AMPARO PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO GRANDE DO SULFUNDAO DE AMPARO PESQUISA DO ESTADO DO RIO GRANDE DO SUL,002097-2552/13-61","01664328","BEHAVIOURAL BRAIN RESEARCH","ENGLISH",NA,NA,4,NA,NA,"1-8","ELSEVIER B.V.","29614250","SCOPUS","PATERNAL PHYSICAL EXERCISE DEMETHYLATES THE HIPPOCAMPAL DNA OF MALE PUPS WITHOUT MODIFYING THE COGNITIVE AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056267344&doi=10.1016%2fj.bbr.2018.03.040&partnerID=40&md5=2a7e6e9be96142e89228c3f37e06908a","348",2018,"THE AUTHORS ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO PHD MATILDE ACHAVAL, FOUNDER OF THE LABORATRIO DE HISTOFISIOLOGIA COMPARADA, AT UFRGS, FOR THE LABORATORYS STRUCTURE, TO SILVIA BARBOSA, FOR THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND TO PHD VIVIANE ROSTIROLLA ELSNER FOR REVIEWING THE ARTICLE.

HOWEVER, WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT HOW THESE DIFFERENT PARENTAL CHARACTERISTICS INTERACT TO DETERMINE PARENTAL EFFECTS, OR THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEIR EFFECT ON OFFSPRING DEPENDS ON EITHER THE SEX OF THE PARENT OR THAT OF THE OFFSPRING. HERE WE EXPERIMENTALLY TESTED FOR EFFECTS OF VARIATION IN PARENTS EARLY DIET AND INBREEDING LEVELS, AS WELL AS EFFECTS OF PARENTAL AGE, AND FOR POTENTIAL INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF THESE THREE FACTORS ON KEY ASPECTS OF OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT IN THE MOSQUITOFISH (GAMBUSIA HOLBROOKI). OLDER MOTHERS PRODUCED OFFSPRING THAT WERE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER AT BIRTH. THIS NEGATIVE EFFECT OF MATERNAL AGE ON OFFSPRING SIZE WAS STILL EVIDENT AT MATURATION AS OLDER MOTHERS HAD SMALLER DAUGHTERS, BUT NOT SMALLER SONS. THE DAUGHTERS OF OLDER MOTHERS DID, HOWEVER, REACH MATURITY SOONER. PATERNAL AGE DID NOT AFFECT OFFSPRING BODY SIZE, BUT IT HAD A COMPLEX EFFECT ON THEIR SONS RELATIVE GENITAL SIZE. WHEN INITIALLY RAISED ON A FOOD-RESTRICTED DIET, OLDER FATHERS SIRED SONS WITH RELATIVELY SMALLER GENITALIA, BUT WHEN FATHERS WERE INITIALLY RAISED ON A CONTROL DIET THEIR SONS HAD RELATIVELY LARGER GENITALIA. THE INBREEDING STATUS OF MOTHERS AND FATHERS HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON ANY OF THE MEASURED OFFSPRING TRAITS. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE MANIFESTATION OF PARENTAL EFFECTS CAN BE COMPLEX. IT CAN VARY WITH BOTH PARENT AND OFFSPRING SEX; CAN CHANGE OVER AN OFFSPRING'S LIFE; AND IS SOMETIMES EVIDENT AS AN INTERACTION BETWEEN DIFFERENT PARENTAL TRAITS. UNDERSTANDING THIS COMPLEXITY WILL BE IMPORTANT TO PREDICT THE ROLE OF PARENTAL EFFECTS IN ADAPTATION. 2018 EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY.

METHODS: OFFSPRING (F1) OF UNEXPOSED OR EXPOSED TO SEVOFLURANE ON POSTNATAL DAY 5 SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS (F0) WERE SUBJECTED TO BEHAVIOURAL AND BRAIN GENE EXPRESSION EVALUATIONS. RESULTS: MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE, PROGENY OF SEVOFLURANE-EXPOSED PARENTS EXHIBITED ABNORMALITIES IN BEHAVIOURAL TESTING AND KCC2 EXPRESSION. MALE F1 RATS OF BOTH EXPOSED PARENTS EXHIBITED IMPAIRED SPATIAL MEMORY AND EXPRESSION OF HIPPOCAMPAL AND HYPOTHALAMIC KCC2. OFFSPRING OF ONLY EXPOSED SIRES HAD ABNORMALITIES IN ELEVATED PLUS MAZE AND PREPULSE INHIBITION OF STARTLE, BUT NORMAL SPATIAL MEMORY AND IMPAIRED EXPRESSION OF HYPOTHALAMIC, BUT NOT HIPPOCAMPAL, KCC2. IN CONTRAST TO EXPOSED F0, THEIR PROGENY EXHIBITED NORMAL CORTICOSTERONE RESPONSES TO STRESS. BISULPHITE SEQUENCING REVEALED INCREASED CPG SITE METHYLATION IN THE KCC2 PROMOTER IN F0 SPERM AND F1 MALE HIPPOCAMPUS AND HYPOTHALAMUS THAT WAS IN CONCORDANCE WITH THE CHANGES IN KCC2 EXPRESSION IN SPECIFIC F1 GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS: NEONATAL EXPOSURE TO SEVOFLURANE CAN AFFECT THE NEXT GENERATION OF MALES THROUGH EPIGENETIC MODIFICATION OF KCC2 EXPRESSION, WHILE F1 FEMALES ARE AT DIMINISHED RISK. 2018 BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA",NA,"CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; SEVOFLURANE, 28523-86-6; ANESTHETICS, INHALATION; CORTICOSTERONE; POTASSIUM-CHLORIDE SYMPORTERS; SEVOFLURANE; SYMPORTERS","BJANA","MARTYNYUK, A.E.; DEPARTMENT OF ANESTHESIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA COLLEGE OF MEDICINEUNITED STATES; EMAIL: AMARTYNYUK@ANEST.UFL.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.bja.2018.04.034","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,R01NS091542-S,R01NS091542 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA,81771149,U1404807","00070912","BRITISH JOURNAL OF ANAESTHESIA","ENGLISH",NA,NA,6,"2",NA,"406-416","ELSEVIER LTD","30032879","SCOPUS","ROLE OF EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS IN TRANSMITTING THE EFFECTS OF NEONATAL SEVOFLURANE EXPOSURE TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE, RATS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047911219&doi=10.1016%2fj.bja.2018.04.034&partnerID=40&md5=1fc2dc0fe6658928e60483e348ef57e8","121",2018,"NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH ( R01NS091542 , R01NS091542-S TO A.E.M.), I.

ROSUVASTATIN IS A STATIN THAT DECREASES SERUM TOTAL CHOLESTEROL. ASCORBIC ACID IS AN IMPORTANT ANTIOXIDANT COMPOUND FOR MALE REPRODUCTION. PRE-PUBERTAL MALE RATS WERE DISTRIBUTED INTO SIX EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS THAT RECEIVED SALINE SOLUTION 0.9% (VEHICLE), 3 OR 10 MG/KG/DAY OF ROSUVASTATIN, 150 MG/DAY OF ASCORBIC ACID, OR 3 OR 10 MG/KG/DAY OF ROSUVASTATIN CO-ADMINISTERED WITH 150 MG/DAY OF ASCORBIC ACID BY GAVAGE FROM POST-NATAL DAY (PND)23 UNTIL PND53. RATS WERE MAINTAINED UNTIL ADULTHOOD AND MATED WITH NULLIPAROUS FEMALES TO OBTAIN THE MALE OFFSPRING, WHOSE ANIMALS WERE EVALUATED AT ADULTHOOD IN RELATION TO REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS. THIS STUDY IS A FOLLOW UP OF A PREVIOUS PAPER ADDRESSING POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON F0 GENERATION ONLY (LEITE ET AL., 2017). MALE OFFSPRING FROM ROSUVASTATIN-EXPOSED GROUPS SHOWED INCREASED SPERM DNA FRAGMENTATION, ANDROGEN DEPLETION AND IMPAIRMENT ON THE TESTICULAR AND EPIDIDYMAL STRUCTURE. ASCORBIC ACID COADMINISTERED TO THE FATHERS AMELIORATED THE REPRODUCTIVE DAMAGE IN THE OFFSPRING. IN SUMMARY, PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO ROSUVASTATIN MAY AFFECT THE REPRODUCTION IN THE MALE OFFSPRING; HOWEVER, PATERNAL SUPPLEMENTATION WITH ASCORBIC ACID WAS ABLE TO REDUCE THE REPRODUCTIVE IMPAIRMENT IN THE MALE OFFSPRING CAUSED BY STATIN TREATMENT TO THE FATHERS. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"ASCORBIC ACID, 134-03-2, 15421-15-5, 50-81-7; ROSUVASTATIN, 147098-18-8, 147098-20-2; ASCORBIC ACID; HYDROXYMETHYLGLUTARYL-COA REDUCTASE INHIBITORS; ROSUVASTATIN CALCIUM","FCTOD","LEITE, G.A.A.; DEPARTAMENTO DE MORFOLOGIA, INSTITUTO DE BIOCINCIAS, UNESP, RUA PROF.

WE EXAMINED WHETHER THE METABOLIC CONSEQUENCES IN OFFSPRING COULD BE ABOLISHED BY FOLATE TREATMENT OF EITHER THE MALE RATS BEFORE MATING OR THE CORRESPONDING FEMALE RATS DURING PREGNANCY. METHODS: MALE F0 RATS WERE FED EITHER CONTROL DIET OR HIGH-FAT, HIGH-SUCROSE AND HIGH-SALT DIET (HFSSD), WITH OR WITHOUT FOLATE, BEFORE MATING. MALE RATS WERE MATED WITH CONTROL-DIET-FED DAMS. AFTER MATING, THE F0 DAMS WERE FED CONTROL DIET WITH OR WITHOUT FOLATE DURING PREGNANCY. RESULTS: MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE OFFSPRING OF HFSSD-FED FOUNDERS WERE HEAVIER THAN THOSE OF CONTROL-DIET-FED COUNTERPARTS (P < 0.05 AND P = 0.066 IN MALES AND FEMALES, RESPECTIVELY). BOTH MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING OF HFSSD-FED FOUNDERS WERE LONGER COMPARED WITH CONTROL (P < 0.01 FOR BOTH SEXES). FOLATE TREATMENT OF THE PREGNANT DAMS ABOLISHED THE EFFECT OF THE PATERNAL DIET ON THE OFFSPRINGS BODY LENGTH (P0.05). FEMALE OFFSPRING OF HFSSD-FED FOUNDERS DEVELOPED IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE, WHICH WAS RESTORED BY FOLATE TREATMENT OF THE DAMS DURING PREGNANCY. THE BETA CELL DENSITY PER PANCREATIC ISLET WAS DECREASED IN OFFSPRING OF HFSSD-FED RATS (20% IN MALE AND 15% IN FEMALE F1 OFFSPRING, P0.001 VS CONTROLS). FOLATE TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE BETA CELL DENSITY (4.3% AND 3.3% AFTER FOLATE SUPPLEMENTATION GIVEN TO DAMS AND FOUNDERS, RESPECTIVELY, P0.05 VS THE OFFSPRING OF HFSSD-FED MALE RATS). CHANGES IN LIVER CONNECTIVE TISSUE OF FEMALE OFFSPRING OF HFSSD-FED FOUNDERS WERE AMELIORATED BY TREATMENT OF DAMS WITH FOLATE (P0.01). HEPATIC PPARA GENE EXPRESSION WAS UPREGULATED IN FEMALE OFFSPRING ONLY (1.51-FOLD, P0.05) AND WAS RESTORED IN THE FEMALE OFFSPRING BY FOLATE TREATMENT (P0.05). WE OBSERVED AN INCREASE IN HEPATIC LCN2 AND TMCC2 EXPRESSION IN FEMALE OFFSPRING BORN TO MALE RATS EXPOSED TO AN UNHEALTHY DIET DURING SPERMATOGENESIS BEFORE MATING (P0.05 VS CONTROLS). FOLATE TREATMENT OF THE CORRESPONDING DAMS DURING PREGNANCY ABOLISHED THIS EFFECT (P0.05). ANALYSIS OF DNA METHYLATION LEVELS OF CPG ISLANDS IN THE PPARA, LCN2 AND TMCC2 PROMOTER REGIONS REVEALED THAT THE PATERNAL UNHEALTHY DIET INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN THE METHYLATION PATTERN. THESE PATTERNS WERE ALSO AFFECTED BY FOLATE TREATMENT. TOTAL LIVER DNA METHYLATION WAS INCREASED BY 1.52-FOLD IN FEMALE OFFSPRING BORN TO MALE RATS ON AN UNHEALTHY DIET PRIOR TO MATING (P0.05). THIS EFFECT WAS ABOLISHED BY FOLATE TREATMENT DURING PREGNANCY (P0.05 VS THE OFFSPRING OF HFSSD-FED MALE RATS).

J. NUTR.","PURPOSE: STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THE INFLUENCE OF MOTHERS OBESITY ON OFFSPRING. HOWEVER, THE FATHER IS ALSO RELATED TO PROGRAMMING THE FUTURE GENERATION. THE STUDY AIMED TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF FATHERS OBESITY UPON WHITE ADIPOSE TISSUE (WAT) REMODELING, RESULTING IN ACTIVATION OF SIGNALING PATHWAYS AND INFLAMMATION IN MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING. METHODS: MALE C57BL/6 MICE RECEIVED CONTROL DIET (LEAN FATHER GROUP; 17% ENERGY FROM LIPIDS) OR HIGH-FAT DIET (OBESE FATHER GROUP; 49% ENERGY FROM LIPIDS) FOR 8 WEEKS BEFORE MATING. THE MOTHERS RECEIVED CONTROL DIET THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENT. MICE WERE MATED: LEAN MOTHER AND LEAN FATHER, AND LEAN MOTHER AND OBESE FATHER. OFFSPRING RECEIVED CONTROL DIET FROM WEANING UNTIL 3MONTHS OF AGE WHEN THEY WERE STUDIED. RESULTS: IN THE OFFSPRING, FATHERS OBESITY LED TO DECREASED QUICKI WITH IMPAIRMENT OF THE INSULIN SIGNALING PATHWAY IN BOTH SEXES. IN LINE WITH THESE FINDINGS, IN WHITE ADIPOSE TISSUE, MALE OFFSPRING DEMONSTRATED HYPERTROPHIED ADIPOCYTES, ENHANCED PROINFLAMMATORY CYTOKINES, OVERACTIVATION OF COMPONENTS OF THE LOCAL RENINANGIOTENSIN SYSTEM (RAS) AND EXTRACELLULAR SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASE 1/2 (ERK1/2), AND INHIBITION OF PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR-ACTIVATED RECEPTORS (ALPHA AND GAMMA). CONCLUSIONS: WE OBSERVED THAT FATHERS OBESITY INFLUENCES THE OFFSPRING IN ADULT LIFE, WITH AN IMPAIRMENT IN INSULIN HOMEOSTASIS, ADIPOCYTE REMODELING, AND ADIPOSE TISSUE OVEREXPRESSION OF IL-6 AND TNF-ALPHA IN MALE OFFSPRING. THE ACTIVATION OF LOCAL RAS AND ERK1/2, A CONCOMITANT PPAR DIMINISHING, AND IMPAIRMENT IN PHOSPHORYLATION OF AKT AND IRS-1 COULD EXPLAIN AT LEAST IN PART THE FINDINGS REGARDLESS OF THE INCREASE IN BODY MASS IN THE OFFSPRING. 2017, SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN HEIDELBERG.",NA,"DEOXYRIBONUCLEASE I, 9003-98-9; DIPEPTIDYL CARBOXYPEPTIDASE, 9015-82-1; INSULIN RECEPTOR SUBSTRATE 1, 175335-32-7; MITOGEN ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE, 142243-02-5; MITOGEN ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 1, 137632-08-7; MITOGEN ACTIVATED PROTEIN KINASE 3, 137632-07-6; PEROXISOME PROLIFERATOR ACTIVATED RECEPTOR ALPHA, 147258-70-6; PROTEIN KINASE B, 148640-14-6; RENIN, 61506-93-2, 9015-94-5","EJNUF","MANDARIM-DE-LACERDA, C.A.; UNIVERSIDADE DO ESTADO DO RIO DE JANEIRO, CENTRO BIOMDICO, INSTITUTO DE BIOLOGIA, LABORATRIO DE MORFOMETRIA, METABOLISMO E DOENA CARDIOVASCULAR, AV 28 DE SETEMBRO 87 FDS, BRAZIL; EMAIL: MANDARIM@UERJ.BR","ARTICLE","10.1007/s00394-017-1473-4",NA,"14366207","EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUTRITION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,1,"5",NA,"1901-1912","DR.

MYRIAD ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS INFLUENCE DNA METHYLATION, INCLUDING METHYL DONOR CONTENT IN THE PATERNAL DIET, COULD INFLUENCE METHYLATION IN OFFSPRING VIA CHANGES IN THE PATERNAL GERM LINE. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINES THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL METHYL DONOR DIETARY DEFICIENCY ON OFFSPRINGS EMOTIONAL BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING ANXIETY, SOCIAL INTERACTION, AND DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR. WE PREVIOUSLY FOUND THAT RATS BRED TO DISPLAY HIGH LEVELS OF ANXIETY- AND DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR EXHIBIT DIMINISHED DNA METHYLATION IN THE AMYGDALA. WE ALSO OBSERVED THAT DEPLETING DIETARY METHYL DONOR CONTENT EXACERBATED THE RATS ALREADY HIGH LEVELS OF ANXIETY- AND DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR. HERE WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER PATERNAL DIETARY METHYL DONOR DEPLETION ELICITS INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS ON FIRST GENERATION (F1) OFFSPRINGS BEHAVIOR (POTENTIALLY TRIGGERING A SIMILAR INCREASE IN ANXIETY- AND/OR DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR). THUS, ADULT MALE RATS PRONE TO HIGH ANXIETY/DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR, WERE FED EITHER A METHYL DONOR DEPLETED (DEP) OR CONTROL (CON) DIET FOR 5 WEEKS PRIOR TO MATING. THEY WERE PAIRED WITH FEMALES AND RESULTANT F1 MALE OFFSPRING WERE SUBJECTED TO A BEHAVIORAL TEST BATTERY IN ADULTHOOD. F1-DEP OFFSPRING SHOWED A SIMILAR BEHAVIORAL PROFILE TO THE F0 MALES, INCLUDING GREATER DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN THE FORCED SWIM TEST (FST) AND INCREASED ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN THE OPEN FIELD TEST (OFT). FUTURE WORK WILL INTERROGATE MOLECULAR CHANGES IN THE BRAINS OF F1 OFFSPRING THAT MEDIATE THESE INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF PATERNAL METHYL DONOR DIETARY CONTENT ON OFFSPRING EMOTIONAL BEHAVIOR. 2018 THE AUTHOR(S).","BSR20180730","METHIONINE, 59-51-8, 63-68-3, 7005-18-7","BRPTD","CLINTON, S.M.; SCHOOL OF NEUROSCIENCE, VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIC INSTITUTE AND STATE UNIVERSITYUNITED STATES; EMAIL: SCLINTON@VT.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1042/BSR20180730","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,R01MH105447-01,5T90DE022736-04","01448463","BIOSCIENCE REPORTS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,1,"4",NA,NA,"PORTLAND PRESS LTD","29945927","SCOPUS","A PATERNAL METHYL DONOR DEPLETED DIET LEADS TO INCREASED ANXIETY- AND DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN ADULT RAT OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049515664&doi=10.1042%2fBSR20180730&partnerID=40&md5=0ab50c779b4c7f4122e7e776b8a4b574","38",2018,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (NIH) [GRANT NUMBERS R01MH105447-01 (TO S.M.C.), 5T90DE022736-04 (TO C.R.M.)].

IVERMECTIN RESIDUES ARE EXCRETED IN DUNG, THREATENING NON-TARGET COPROPHAGOUS FAUNA SUCH AS DUNG BEETLES. THIS CAN HAVE SEVERE ECOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES FOR DUNG DEGRADATION AND SOIL FERTILITY. EVEN THOUGH THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF DIRECT IVERMECTIN EXPOSURE ON DUNG-DEGRADING ORGANISMS ARE WELL KNOWN, EFFECTS COULD EXTEND ACROSS GENERATIONS. HERE, WE TESTED THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL OR MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO IVERMECTIN ON OFFSPRING IN THE DUNG BEETLE EUONITICELLUS INTERMEDIUS. THIS SPECIES IS A CLASSIC STUDY SUBJECT IN ECOTOXICOLOGY AND SEXUAL SELECTION BECAUSE MALES HAVE A CEPHALIC HORN THAT IS UNDER INTENSE SELECTION VIA MALE-MALE COMPETITION. AFTER CONFIRMING A NEGATIVE EFFECT OF IVERMECTIN ON THE NUMBER OF EMERGED BEETLES, WE FOUND TRANS-GENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF IVERMECTIN EXPOSURE ON THE HORN SIZE OF MALE OFFSPRING. SURPRISINGLY HOWEVER, THIS TRANS-GENERATIONAL EFFECT ONLY OCCURRED WHEN ONLY THE FATHER WAS EXPOSED. WE DETECTED NO TRANS-GENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF IVERMECTIN EXPOSURE ON OFFSPRING NUMBER, SEX RATIO OR BODY SIZE. OUR RESULTS CONFIRM THAT IVERMECTIN NOT ONLY HAS A STRONG EFFECT ON EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS BUT ALSO IN THEIR PROGENY. OUR STUDY OPENS NEW QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MECHANISMS RESPONSIBLE FOR PARENTAL EFFECTS AND THEIR LONG-TERM FITNESS CONSEQUENCES IN CONTAMINATED HABITATS. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"IVERMECTIN, 70288-86-7; ANTIPARASITIC AGENTS; IVERMECTIN","CMSHA","GONZLEZ-TOKMAN, D.; INSTITUTO DE ECOLOGA A.

TOXICOL. CHEM.","THE EFFECTS OF PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO PHARMACEUTICALS ON SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION IN F1 OFFSPRING WERE EXAMINED IN ZEBRAFISH (DANIO RERIO). ADULT ZEBRAFISH WERE EXPOSED TO 0 OR 10 G/L OF CARBAMAZEPINE OR GEMFIBROZIL FOR 6 WK AND BRED IN PAIRWISE CROSSES TO GENERATE 7 DISTINCT LINEAGES. LINEAGES WERE FORMED WITH BOTH PARENTS FROM THE SAME TREATMENT GROUP OR WITH ONLY ONE PARENT EXPOSED, TO DELINEATE BETWEEN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EFFECTS. THE F1 OFFSPRING FROM EACH LINEAGE WERE REARED IN CLEAN WATER AND SAMPLED AT 45 AND 60 D POST FERTILIZATION (DPF). GONADAL DIFFERENTIATION WAS ASSESSED BY HISTOLOGY. THE MORPHOLOGICAL STAGES OF THE GONADS WERE CONVERTED TO A QUANTITATIVE DAY-EQUIVALENT BASED ON DATA FROM OFFSPRING OF UNTREATED PARENTS SAMPLED FROM 15 TO 75 DPF, WHICH ENABLED A QUANTITATIVE STATISTICAL ANALYSIS ON THE TIMING OF SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION. PATERNAL, BUT NOT MATERNAL, EXPOSURE TO CARBAMAZEPINE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION AND A MALE-BIASED SEX RATIO; THESE EFFECTS WERE NOT OBSERVED WHEN BOTH PARENTS WERE EXPOSED. COMBINED PATERNAL AND MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO GEMFIBROZIL RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION, AND PATERNAL, BUT NOT MATERNAL, EXPOSURE TO GEMFIBROZIL LED TO MALE-BIASED SEX RATIOS. THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATES THE ABILITY OF PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO PHARMACEUTICALS TO DISRUPT SEXUAL DIFFERENTIATION IN THE F1 OFFSPRING AND ALSO SHOWS THAT EFFECTS MAY BE UNIQUELY INFLUENCED BY WHICH PARENT WAS EXPOSED.

PARENTAL COCAINE USE POSES SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISKS TO THE OFFSPRING, THROUGH BOTH MATERNAL AND PATERNAL DRUG INFLUENCES. WITH RESPECT TO THE LATTER, RECENT EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT A PATERNAL MODE OF COCAINE INHERITANCE INVOLVES EPIGENETIC GERM LINE ACTIONS THAT CAN ULTIMATELY DISRUPT OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR. BASED ON OUR PREVIOUS REPORT IN MICE THAT FREE-RUNNING CIRCADIAN PERIOD (TAU) IS CHRONICALLY LENGTHENED FOLLOWING WITHDRAWAL FROM LONG-TERM COCAINE TREATMENT, THE PRESENT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO EXPLORE POTENTIAL EPIGENETIC EFFECTS OF PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO COCAINE OVER THE 40-DAY MURINE SPERMATOGENIC CYCLE ON F1 CIRCADIAN REGULATORY FUNCTIONS. HERE WE SHOW THAT, ALTHOUGH WITHDRAWAL OF SIRES FROM THE COCAINE TREATMENT LENGTHENED THEIR TAU, SUCH AN EFFECT DID NOT PERSIST IN ADULT F1 MALE OR FEMALE OFFSPRING BORN FROM DRUG-NAVE DAMS. NOTABLY, HOWEVER, THERE WAS A DISTINCT DEFICIT IN THE ABILITY OF F1 COCAINE-SIRED MALES, BUT NOT FEMALES, TO UNDERGO LIGHT-INDUCED PHASE DELAY SHIFTS OF THE CIRCADIAN CLOCK. IN CONTRAST, F1 COCAINE-SIRED FEMALES, BUT NOT MALES, HAD SUPPRESSED CIRCADIAN PHASE ADVANCE SHIFTING RESPONSES TO TWO NON-PHOTIC STIMULI: ACUTE I.P. INJECTIONS OF COCAINE AND THE SEROTONIN AGONIST ([+]8-OH-DPAT). THE REDUCED COCAINE SHIFTING IN FEMALES WAS NOT DUE TO SUPPRESSED COCAINE-INDUCED BEHAVIORAL AROUSAL. COLLECTIVELY, THESE RESULTS REVEAL THAT A FATHER'S COCAINE USE CAN DISRUPT MAJOR CIRCADIAN ENTRAINMENT MECHANISMS IN HIS ADULT PROGENY IN A SEX-DEPENDENT MANNER. 2018 IBRO",NA,"2 DIPROPYLAMINO 8 HYDROXYTETRALIN, 78950-78-4; COCAINE, 50-36-2, 53-21-4, 5937-29-1; 8-HYDROXY-2-(DI-N-PROPYLAMINO)TETRALIN; COCAINE; DOPAMINE UPTAKE INHIBITORS; SEROTONIN RECEPTOR AGONISTS","NRSCD","GLASS, J.D.; SCHOOL OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, KENT STATE UNIV.UNITED STATES; EMAIL: JGLASS@KENT.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.neuroscience.2018.03.012","DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, PURDUE UNIVERSITYDEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, PURDUE UNIVERSITY","03064522","NEUROSCIENCE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,1,NA,NA,"257-268","ELSEVIER LTD","29567492","SCOPUS","PATERNAL COCAINE DISRUPTS OFFSPRING CIRCADIAN CLOCK FUNCTION IN A SEX-DEPENDENT MANNER IN MICE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85056412749&doi=10.1016%2fj.neuroscience.2018.03.012&partnerID=40&md5=9a4be1c80b1df0838f072515eca4cce1","379",2018,"THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE DR.

STRESS, DIET, DRUG USE) CORRELATE WITH METABOLIC DYSFUNCTION IN OFFSPRING, WHICH IS OFTEN COMORBID WITH DEPRESSIVE AND ANXIETY-LIKE PHENOTYPES. DETECTION OF THESE RISK FACTORS OR DELETERIOUS PHENOTYPES INFORMS A FEMALE ABOUT PREVAILING ECOLOGICAL DEMANDS, IN ADDITION TO POTENTIAL ADVERSE ENVIRONMENT-INDUCED PHENOTYPES THAT MAY BE DISSEMINATED TO HER OFFSPRING. WE EXAMINED WHETHER A F0 MALE RAT'S PRIOR EXPOSURE TO AN OBESOGENIC HIGH-FAT DIET (HFD) INFLUENCES A FEMALE'S ATTRACTION TOWARDS A MALE, SUBSEQUENT MOTHER-INFANT INTERACTIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEFENSIVE (EMOTIONAL) RESPONSES IN THE F1 OFFSPRING. FEMALES DISPLAYED LESS INTEREST IN THE HFD EXPOSED F0 MALES RELATIVE TO CONTROL DIET-EXPOSED F0 MALES. DAMS THAT REARED F1 OFFSPRING IN LARGER, SEMI-NATURALISTIC HOUSING PROVIDED MORE LICKING AND GROOMING AND ACTIVE ARCHED-BACK-NURSING BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER, SOME OF THESE EFFECTS INTERACTED WITH PATERNAL EXPERIENCE. F0 HFD AND MATERNAL REARING ENVIRONMENT REVEALED SEX-DEPENDENT, BETWEEN GROUP DIFFERENCES IN F1 OFFSPRING WEAN WEIGHT, JUVENILE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS AND ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN ADOLESCENCE. OUR RESULTS SHOW FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MAMMALS THAT MALE EXPOSURE TO HFD MAY CONTRIBUTE TO STABLE BEHAVIORAL VARIATION AMONG FEMALES IN COURTSHIP, MATERNAL CARE, EVEN WHEN THE FEMALES ARE NOT DIRECTLY EXPOSED TO A HFD, AND ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN F1 OFFSPRING. FURTHERMORE, WHEN OFFSPRING WERE EXPOSED TO A PREDATORY THREAT, HYPOTHALAMIC CRF GENE REGULATION WAS INFLUENCED BY EARLY HOUSING. THESE RESULTS, TOGETHER WITH OUR PREVIOUS FINDINGS, SUGGEST THAT PATERNAL EXPERIENCE AND MATERNAL REARING CONDITIONS CAN INFLUENCE MATERNAL BEHAVIOR AND DEVELOPMENT OF DEFENSIVE RESPONSES OF OFFSPRING. 2018 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING FACTOR, 9015-71-8, 178359-01-8, 79804-71-0, 86297-72-5, 86784-80-7","PSYCD","PERROT, T.S.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE, DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITYCANADA; EMAIL: TARA.PERROT@DAL.CA","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.psyneuen.2018.02.010","NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADANATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA,NSERC,RGPIN-2014-04348,RGPIN-2013-436204 MED-SS-2014-9644","03064530","PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,3,NA,NA,"20-30","ELSEVIER LTD","29518693","SCOPUS","EFFECTS OF PATERNAL HIGH-FAT DIET AND REARING ENVIRONMENT ON MATERNAL INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF DEFENSIVE RESPONSES IN THE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042880721&doi=10.1016%2fj.psyneuen.2018.02.010&partnerID=40&md5=131ec995a3da78bbc51e795c28f4cfdd","91",2018,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY DISCOVERY GRANTS FROM THE NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA TO T.S.P.

MACROMOL.","TO LEARN THE NUTRI-EPIGENETICS ROLE OF ASTRAGALUS POLYSACCHARIDES (APS), WE DESIGNED AND STUDIED THE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECT OF PATERNAL DIETARY APS SUPPLEMENTATION IN CHICKENS. 160 AVEIN BREEDER COCKS WERE RANDOMLY ALLOCATED INTO 5 GROUPS AND FED WITH 0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, AND 10 G/KG APS SUPPLEMENT, RESPECTIVELY. SPERM OF BREEDER COCKS WAS COLLECTED AND USED FOR HATCHING EXPERIMENT TO GET BROILER CHICKENS WHEN THE COCKS AT 40-WEEKS-OLD. IT SHOWED THAT THE PATERNAL DIETARY 10 G/KG APS COULD TRANSGENERATIONAL PROMOTE GROWTH PERFORMANCE AND JEJUNAL TISSUE MORPHOLOGY OF CHICKENS. AS TO PHENOTYPES, 10 G/KG APS TREATMENT WAS CHOSEN FOR MOLECULAR ASSAYS. IN JEJUNAL MUCOSA, 10 G/KG DIETARY APS DIDN'T HAVE ANY SYSTEMATIC EFFECT ON GENE TRANSCRIPTION OF BREEDER COCKS, WHEREAS, THE APS COULD INDUCE TRANSGENERATIONAL ENDOTOXIN TOLERANCE-LIKE EFFECT THROUGH ACTIVATING THE IFN-SOCS1 PATHWAY IN CHICKS. IN BOTH JEJUNUM AND SPERM, THE PROMOTER METHYLATION LEVEL OF SOCS1 SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED IN 10 G/KG APS TREATMENT VERSUS THE CONTROL GROUP. IN ADDITION, THE PATERNAL APS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED HISTONE MODIFICATION IN PROMOTOR REGION OF TRIF. OUR DATA REVEALED THAT THE PATERNAL DIETARY APS SUPPLEMENTATION COULD INDUCE TRANSGENERATIONAL ENDOTOXIN TOLERANCE-LIKE EFFECT IN JEJUNUM MUCOSA OF BROILER CHICKENS.

EXPOSURE TO BPA DURING GESTATION HAS BEEN PROPOSED AS A RISK FACTOR FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEUROBEHAVIORAL DISORDERS, SUCH AS AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER. TO ADDRESS THE BEHAVIORAL IMPACT OF DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE TO BPA, WE TESTED OFFSPRING OF MICE EXPOSED TO A DAILY LOW DOSE OF BPA DURING PREGNANCY. WE ALSO ASKED IF PRECONCEPTION EXPOSURE OF THE SIRE AFFECTED BEHAVIORS IN OFFSPRING. SIRES THAT CONSUMED BPA FOR 50 DAYS PRIOR TO MATING WEIGHED LESS THAN CONTROLS, BUT NO EFFECTS ON ANY REPRODUCTIVE MEASURES WERE NOTED. JUVENILE OFFSPRING EXPOSED TO BPA MATERNALLY, BUT NOT PATERNALLY, SPENT LESS TIME IN THE OPEN ARMS OF THE ELEVATED PLUS MAZE THAN CONTROLS, INDICATING INCREASED ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR. HOWEVER, NEITHER PARENTAL EXPOSURE GROUP DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM CONTROLS IN THE SOCIAL RECOGNITION TASK. WE ALSO ASSESSED THE BEHAVIORS OF MATERNALLY EXPOSED OFFSPRING IN TWO NOVEL TASKS: ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATIONS (USVS) IN PUPS AND OPERANT REVERSAL LEARNING IN ADULTS. MATERNAL BPA EXPOSURE INCREASED THE DURATION AND MEDIAN FREQUENCY OF USVS EMITTED BY PUPS DURING MATERNAL SEPARATION. IN THE REVERSAL LEARNING TASK, FEMALES RESPONDED MORE ACCURATELY AND EARNED MORE REWARDS THAN MALES. ADDITIONALLY, CONTROL FEMALES RECEIVED MORE REWARDS THAN BPA FEMALES DURING THE ACQUISITION PHASE OF THE TASK. THESE ARE AMONG THE FIRST STUDIES CONDUCTED TO ASK IF BPA EXPOSURE VIA THE SIRE AFFECTS OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR AND THE FIRST STUDY TO REPORT EFFECTS OF GESTATIONAL BPA EXPOSURE ON PUP USVS AND ADULT OPERANT RESPONDING. 2017 ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"4,4' ISOPROPYLIDENEDIPHENOL, 80-05-7; BENZHYDRYL COMPOUNDS; BISPHENOL A; ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS; PHENOLS","HOBEA","RISSMAN, E.F.; CENTER FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT, NORTH CAROLINA STATE UNIVERSITYUNITED STATES; EMAIL: E_RISSMAN@NCSU.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.yhbeh.2017.09.017",NA,"0018506X","HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR","ENGLISH",NA,NA,6,NA,NA,"68-76","ACADEMIC PRESS INC.","28964733","SCOPUS","EFFECTS OF MATERNAL OR PATERNAL BISPHENOL A EXPOSURE ON OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030483539&doi=10.1016%2fj.yhbeh.2017.09.017&partnerID=40&md5=06544723bee84a2710e5b1e9a6977620","101",2018,"WE THANK JOSHUA IRVIN FOR HIS ASSISTANCE IN SCORING BEHAVIOR VIDEOS.

HIPPOCAMPAL OVEREXPRESSION OF KCNMB2 IN MD F1 MICE AMELIORATED ALTERED SPATIAL LEARNING AND MEMORY, SUPPORTING A ROLE OF THIS BK CHANNEL SUBUNIT IN THE MD F1 BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE.

RES. PERSPECT.","EMERGING EVIDENCE HAS DEMONSTRATED THAT PATERNAL ALCOHOL USE CAN MODIFY THE BEHAVIOR OF OFFSPRING, PARTICULARLY MALE OFFSPRING. HOWEVER, PRECLINICAL STUDIES TO DATE HAVE NOT USED VOLUNTARY SELF-ADMINISTRATION OF ALCOHOL TO EXAMINE ALCOHOL-RELATED BEHAVIORS IN OFFSPRING. HERE, WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT PATERNAL ALCOHOL SELF-ADMINISTRATION FOLLOWED BY PUNISHMENT-IMPOSED ABSTINENCE ALTERS ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND SEEKING IN MALE OFFSPRING. MALE INBRED ALCOHOL PREFERRING IP RATS WERE TRAINED TO SELF-ADMINISTER ALCOHOL IN ONE CONTEXT FOLLOWED BY PUNISHMENT-IMPOSED SUPPRESSION OF ALCOHOL-SEEKING IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT USING CONTINGENT FOOTSHOCK. FOLLOWING THIS, ALL RATS WERE BRED WITH ALCOHOL NAVE FEMALE IP RATS. F1 OFFSPRING WERE THEN TRAINED TO SELF-ADMINISTER ALCOHOL IN AN IDENTICAL OPERANT PARADIGM AS SIRES. ALCOHOL INTAKE AND SELF-ADMINISTRATION BEHAVIORS OF ALCOHOL-SIRED OFFSPRING WERE COMPARED TO CONTROL-SIRED OFFSPRING WHOSE FATHERS HAD NOT BEEN EXPOSED TO THE ALCOHOL OPERANT CONDITIONING EXPERIENCE. WE FOUND THAT PATERNAL ALCOHOL SELF-ADMINISTRATION REDUCED CONTEXT-INDUCED RELAPSE TO ALCOHOL-SEEKING IN MALE OFFSPRING. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT VOLUNTARY PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPERIENCE, OPERANT CONDITIONING, AND PUNISHMENT CAN RESULT IN INTERGENERATIONAL CHANGES IN OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR, AND THAT THIS EFFECT MAY PROTECT AGAINST THE VULNERABILITY TO RELAPSE AFTER ALCOHOL USE.

METHODS: A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY WAS CONDUCTED OF 311 MOTHER-CHILD AND 122 FATHERCHILD DYADS WHO ATTENDED A LARGE PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE PRACTICE. CHILDREN WERE BORN FROM OCTOBER 2012 TO JUNE 2014, AND DATA WERE COLLECTED AT THE 2-, 4-, AND 24-MONTH WELL-CHILD VISITS. MULTIVARIABLE POISSON REGRESSION WITH ROBUST ERROR VARIANCE WAS USED TO MODEL THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SELF-REPORTED PARENTAL ACES AND THE OUTCOMES OF SUSPECTED DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY AT 24 MONTHS AND ELIGIBILITY FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. RESULTS: FOR EACH ADDITIONAL MATERNAL ACE, THERE WAS AN 18% INCREASE IN THE RISK FOR A SUSPECTED DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY (RELATIVE RISK: 1.18, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 1.08-1.29). A SIMILAR TREND WAS OBSERVED FOR PATERNAL ACES (RELATIVE RISK: 1.34, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL: 1.07-1.67). THREE OR MORE MATERNAL ACES (VERSUS <3 ACES) WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED RISK FOR A SUSPECTED DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY THAT AFFECTED MULTIPLE DOMAINS. SIMILAR EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED FOR EARLY INTERVENTION SERVICES. CONCLUSIONS: PARENTAL ACE EXPOSURES CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT CHILD DEVELOPMENT IN MULTIPLE DOMAINS, INCLUDING PROBLEM SOLVING, COMMUNICATION, PERSONAL-SOCIAL, AND MOTOR SKILLS. RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO ELUCIDATE THE PSYCHOSOCIAL AND BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS OF INTERGENERATIONAL RISK. THIS RESEARCH HAS IMPLICATIONS FOR THE VALUE OF PARENTAL ACE SCREENING IN THE CONTEXT OF PEDIATRIC PRIMARY CARE. 2018 BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS.","E20172826",NA,"PEDIA","FOLGER, A.T.; CINCINNATI CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL MEDICAL CENTER, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI, 3333 BURNET AVE, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: ALONZO.FOLGER@CCHMC.ORG","ARTICLE","10.1542/peds.2017-2826",NA,"00314005","PEDIATRICS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,10,"4",NA,NA,"AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS","29563236","SCOPUS","PARENTAL ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT AT 2 YEARS OF AGE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044780698&doi=10.1542%2fpeds.2017-2826&partnerID=40&md5=b07ffdaad9cb0ef9209003940f2f2ebb","141",2018,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI;CHILDREN'S CLINIC","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF CINCINNATI;NOTREPORTED",NA,"FOLGER AT, 2018, PEDIATRICS","FOLGER AT, 2018, PEDIATRICS"

CLIN. EXP. RES.","BACKGROUND: THERE ARE LIMITED STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION, BEFORE CONCEPTION, ON THE REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT OF OFFSPRING. ANOGENITAL DISTANCE (AGD), THE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER OF THE ANUS TO THE GENITALS, IS A SENSITIVE BIOMARKER OF REPRODUCTIVE HORMONE ABNORMALITIES DURING THE CRITICAL DEVELOPMENTAL WINDOW. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PATERNAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION AND AGD OF HUMAN OFFSPRING HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED YET. METHODS: THIS COHORT STUDY INCLUDED 1,292 PREGNANT WOMEN RECRUITED IN SHANGHAI. AN IN-PERSON INTERVIEW WAS CONDUCTED TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF COUPLES, AND HUSBANDS LIFESTYLES, INCLUDING DRINKING HABITS. AGD (BOYS, AGD-AP [ANUS-PENIS], AGD-AS [ANUS-SCROTUM]; GIRLS, AGD-AC [ANUS-CLITORIS], AGD-AF [ANUS-FOURCHETTE]) MEASUREMENTS WERE PERFORMED AT BIRTH, AND AT 6 AND 12MONTHS OF AGE. MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS CONDUCTED TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATERNAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION BEFORE CONCEPTION, AND THE AGDS OF OFFSPRING. RESULTS: DATA INCLUDED AGD MEASUREMENTS OF INFANTS AT BIRTH (N=980), AT 6MONTHS (N=592, 60.4%), AND AT 12MONTHS (N=543, 55.4%). BOYS IN THE PATERNAL ALCOHOL-EXPOSED GROUP HAD SHORTER AGDS, IRRESPECTIVE OF THE AREAS MEASURED (AGD-AP AND AGD-AS) AND TIME OF MEASUREMENTS, THAN THOSE IN THE UNEXPOSED GROUP. HOWEVER, ONLY THE DIFFERENCES IN AGD-AP AT BIRTH AND AGD-AS AT 6MONTHS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. FOR GIRLS, THE ASSOCIATIONS WERE SIMILAR AT BIRTH; HOWEVER, THE AGD-AC AND AGD-AF WERE LONGER IN THE PATERNAL ALCOHOL-EXPOSED GROUP THAN THE UNEXPOSED GROUP AT 12MONTHS. CONCLUSIONS: OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE FIRST, BUT PRELIMINARY EVIDENCE, THAT PATERNAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION WITHIN 3MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTER AGD IN THE OFFSPRING, ESPECIALLY IN BOYS, WHICH INDICATES THAT PATERNAL ALCOHOL DRINKING MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THEIR REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT. FURTHER STUDIES SHOULD BE CONDUCTED TO VALIDATE THESE RESULTS.

ECOL.","GLOBAL RISING OF AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AND INCREASE IN EXTREME CLIMATIC EVENTS MAY LARGELY IMPACT ANIMAL SURVIVAL AND REPRODUCTION. YET, HOW VARIATION IN TEMPERATURE MAY AFFECT MALE FERTILITY, IN PARTICULAR EJACULATE TRAITS, AND WHETHER THIS CAN IN TURN AFFECT OFFSPRING FITNESS, IS SELDOM ADDRESSED. PATERNAL EFFECTS MAY BE OF KEY IMPORTANCE AS THEY COULD IMPACT THE RATE AND DIRECTION OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. WE TESTED THE EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE EXPERIENCED BY MALES ON SPERM TRAITS, AND ASKED WHETHER THE PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE AFFECTED OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE. WE FURTHER EXPLORED THE POTENTIAL FOR PATERNAL EFFECTS TO BE ADAPTIVE, WHICH WOULD OCCUR WHEN OFFSPRING FITNESS INCREASED UNDER THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS EXPERIENCED BY THE FATHERS. WE EXPOSED MALE FIELD CRICKETS TO HIGH OR LOW TEMPERATURES AT TWO LIFE STAGES, EITHER THROUGHOUT DEVELOPMENT OR AS ADULTS, AND TESTED SPERM TRAITS (NUMBER AND QUALITY) AND OFFSPRING FITNESS (HATCHING SUCCESS AND SURVIVAL). WE FURTHER ASSESSED SPERM TRAITS IN OFFSPRING, AFTER THEY HAD ALSO BEEN EXPOSED TO THE SAME OR DIFFERENT TEMPERATURE EXPERIENCED BY THEIR FATHER. WE FOUND THAT TEMPERATURE AFFECTED SPERM TRAITS DEPENDING ON THE LIFE-STAGE OF INDIVIDUALS. WHEN THE EXPOSURE WAS GIVEN DURING ADULTHOOD, MALES EXPOSED TO HIGH TEMPERATURE PRODUCED LESS SPERM AND OF LOWER QUALITY COMPARED TO MALES EXPOSED TO LOWER TEMPERATURE, WHILE IF EXPOSURE WAS GIVEN DURING DEVELOPMENT, MALES EXPOSED TO HIGH TEMPERATURE PRODUCED MORE SPERM AND OF BETTER QUALITY COMPARED TO MALES EXPOSED TO LOW TEMPERATURES. OFFSPRING FITNESS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY PATERNAL TEMPERATURE, EVIDENCE FOR ANTICIPATORY PATERNAL EFFECTS ON SPERM TRAITS WAS NOT FOUND. OUR STUDY INDICATES THAT TEMPERATURE CAN MEDIATE CROSS-GENERATIONAL EFFECTS, AND THAT PATERNAL EFFECTS MAY BE MEDIATED BY CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE AND THEREFORE MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD IN NATURE THAN PREVIOUSLY ASSUMED.

WHILE INHERITANCE OF SHORT TELOMERES FROM OLDER PARENTS COULD UNDERLIE THIS EFFECT, STUDIES TO DATE IN DIFFERENT SPECIES HAVE FOUND MIXED RESULTS, REPORTING POSITIVE, NEGATIVE OR NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PARENTAL AGE AND OFFSPRING TELOMERE LENGTH (TL). HOWEVER, MOST OF THE EXISTING EVIDENCE IS FROM NON-EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES IN WHICH IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXCLUDE ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATIONS SUCH AS DIFFERENTIAL SURVIVAL OF PARENTS WITH DIFFERENT TELOMERE LENGTHS. HERE WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE IN THE ZEBRA FINCH THAT OFFSPRING FROMOLDER PARENTS HAVE REDUCED LIFESPANS. AS A FIRST STEP IN DISENTANGLING POSSIBLE CAUSES, WE USED AN EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH TO EXAMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE COULD DETECT PRE-NATAL PATERNAL EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING TL. WE FOUND THAT ZEBRA FINCH EMBRYOS FATHERED BY OLD MALES HAVE SHORTER TELOMERES THAN THOSE PRODUCED BY THE SAME MOTHERS BUT WITH YOUNGER FATHERS. SINCE VARIATION IN EMBRYONIC TL PERSISTS INTO POST-NATAL LIFE, AND EARLY LIFE TL IS PREDICTIVE OF LONGEVITY IN THIS SPECIES, THIS EXPERIMENTAL STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT A PATERNALLY DRIVEN PRE-NATAL TL REDUCTION COULD AT LEAST IN PART UNDERLIE THE REDUCED LIFESPAN OF OFFSPRING FROM OLDER PARENTS. 2018 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY.","20180268",NA,"PRLBA","NOGUERA, J.C.; DEPARTAMENTO DE ECOLOGA Y BIOLOGA ANIMAL, GRUPO DE ECOLOGA ANIMAL, UNIVERSIDAD DE VIGO, TORRE CACTI, SPAIN; EMAIL: JOSEC.NOGUERA.AMOROS@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1098/rspb.2018.0268",NA,"09628452","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B: BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","ENGLISH",NA,NA,6,"1874",NA,NA,"ROYAL SOCIETY PUBLISHING","29540524","SCOPUS","EXPERIMENTAL DEMONSTRATION THAT OFFSPRING FATHERED BY OLD MALES HAVE SHORTER TELOMERES AND REDUCED LIFESPANS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85044020138&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2018.0268&partnerID=40&md5=e74749a8512c0f734246d7cd56f27229","285",2018,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSIDAD DE VIGO;UNIVERSITY OF GLASGOW","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSIDAD DE VIGO;NOTREPORTED",NA,"NOGUERA JC, 2018, PROC R SOC B BIOL SCI","NOGUERA JC, 2018, PROC R SOC B BIOL SCI"

SCI.","THE PATERNAL TRANSMISSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED PHENOTYPES ACROSS GENERATIONS HAS BEEN REPORTED TO OCCUR FOLLOWING A NUMBER OF QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT EXPOSURES AND APPEAR TO BE DRIVEN, AT LEAST IN PART, BY EPIGENETIC FACTORS THAT ARE INHERITED VIA THE SPERM. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES OF PATERNAL GERMLINE TRANSMISSION HAVE NOT ADDRESSED THE ROLE OF MOTHERS IN THE PROPAGATION OF PATERNAL EFFECTS TO OFFSPRING. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO NUTRITIONAL RESTRICTION WOULD IMPACT MALE MATE QUALITY AND SUBSEQUENT MATERNAL REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR THE TRANSMISSION OF PATERNAL GERMLINE EFFECTS. IN THE CURRENT REPORT, USING EMBRYO TRANSFER IN MICE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT SPERM FACTORS IN ADULT FOOD RESTRICTED MALES CAN INFLUENCE GROWTH RATE, HYPOTHALAMIC GENE EXPRESSION AND BEHAVIOUR IN FEMALE OFFSPRING. HOWEVER, UNDER NATURAL MATING CONDITIONS FEMALES MATED WITH FOOD RESTRICTED MALES SHOW INCREASED PRE- AND POSTNATAL CARE, AND PHENOTYPIC OUTCOMES OBSERVED DURING EMBRYO TRANSFER CONDITIONS ARE ABSENT OR REVERSED. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THESE COMPENSATORY CHANGES IN MATERNAL INVESTMENT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCED MATE PREFERENCE FOR FOOD RESTRICTED MALES AND ELEVATED GENE EXPRESSION WITHIN THE MATERNAL HYPOTHALAMUS. THEREFORE, PATERNAL EXPERIENCE CAN INFLUENCE OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT VIA GERMLINE INHERITANCE, BUT MOTHERS CAN SERVE AS A MODULATING FACTOR IN DETERMINING THE IMPACT OF PATERNAL INFLUENCES ON OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT. 2018 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY.","20180118",NA,"PRLBA","MASHOODH, R.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, 1190 AMSTERDAM AVENUE, ROOM 406 SCHERMERHORN HALL, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: RM786@CAM.AC.UK","ARTICLE","10.1098/rspb.2018.0118",NA,"09628452","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B: BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","ENGLISH",NA,NA,9,"1874",NA,NA,"ROYAL SOCIETY PUBLISHING","29514964","SCOPUS","MATERNAL MODULATION OF PATERNAL EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043602573&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2018.0118&partnerID=40&md5=f93239422eb687e0cd9d06db524a869a","285",2018,"NA NA NA","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE;COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER;UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN","NOTREPORTED;COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MASHOODH R, 2018, PROC R SOC B BIOL SCI","MASHOODH R, 2018, PROC R SOC B BIOL SCI"

IN HUMANS, ADVANCED PATERNAL AGE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED RISK FOR A NUMBER OF DISEASES. EXPERIMENTS IN RODENT MODELS HAVE PROVIDED INITIAL EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL AGE CAN INFLUENCE BEHAVIORAL TRAITS IN OFFSPRING ANIMALS, BUT THE OVERALL SCOPE AND EXTENT OF PATERNAL AGE EFFECTS ON HEALTH AND DISEASE ACROSS THE LIFE SPAN REMAIN UNDEREXPLORED.

DESPITE THIS KNOWLEDGE, LITTLE IS KNOWN REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL HIGH-FAT FEEDING ON OFFSPRING INSULIN SENSITIVITY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE FOR THE FIRST TIME THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL HIGH-FAT FEEDING ON WHOLE-BODY AND SKELETAL MUSCLE INSULIN ACTION IN YOUNG AND ADULT OFFSPRING. AT 4 WEEKS OF AGE, FOUNDER C57BL6/N MALES (F0) WERE FED A HIGH-FAT DIET OR CONTROL DIET FOR 12 WEEKS AND THEN BRED WITH FEMALES ON A CONTROL DIET. OFFSPRING (F1) WERE EUTHANIZED AT 6 WEEKS, 6 MONTHS, OR 12 MONTHS AND INSULINSTIMULATED INSULIN SIGNALING WAS MEASURED EX VIVO IN ISOLATED SOLEUS MUSCLE. AT 6 WEEKS OF AGE, PATERNAL HIGH FAT OFFSPRING (HFO) HAD ENHANCED WHOLEBODY INSULIN SENSITIVITY (35%, P < 0.05), AS WELL AS, INCREASED INSULIN-STIMULATED SKELETAL MUSCLE PHOSPHORYLATION OF AKT THREONINE 308 (70%, P < 0.05) AND AS160 THREONINE 642 (80%, P < 0.05) COMPARED TO PATERNAL CONTROL FED OFFSPRING (CFO), DESPITE BOTH OFFSPRING GROUPS CONSUMING STANDARD CHOW. AT 6 MONTHS OF AGE, HFO HAD INCREASED PERCENT BODY FAT COMPARED TO CFO (74%, P < 0.005) AND WHOLE-BODY AND SKELETAL MUSCLE INSULIN SIGNALING NORMALIZED TO CFO. BODY FAT WAS INVERSELY RELATED WITH INSULIN SIGNALING IN HFO, BUT NOT CFO. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PATERNAL HIGH-FAT FEEDING CONTRIBUTES TO ENHANCED WHOLE-BODY AND SKELETAL MUSCLE INSULIN SENSITIVITY IN HFO EARLY IN LIFE; HOWEVER, THESE BENEFITS ARE LOST BY EARLY ADULTHOOD, POTENTIALLY DUE TO PREMATURE INCREASES IN BODY FAT. 2018 THE AUTHORS.","E13583","PROTEIN KINASE B, 148640-14-6; INSULIN, 9004-10-8; INSULIN",NA,"CONSITT, L.A.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, OHIO UNIVERSITY, 228 IRVINE HALL, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: CONSITT@OHIO.EDU","ARTICLE","10.14814/phy2.13583","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,DK102115 COLLEGE OF MEDICINE OFFICE OF RESEARCH, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITYCOLLEGE OF MEDICINE OFFICE OF RESEARCH, OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY","2051817X","PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,0,"5","10",NA,"AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY","29484855","SCOPUS","PATERNAL HIGH-FAT DIET ENHANCES OFFSPRING WHOLE-BODY INSULIN SENSITIVITY AND SKELETAL MUSCLE INSULIN SIGNALING EARLY IN LIFE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043588647&doi=10.14814%2fphy2.13583&partnerID=40&md5=e3bf9e58cef00a5e5b64e51247cc86e2","6",2018,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY GRANTS FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH (DK102115) TO L.A.C AND THE OHIO UNIVERSITY RESEARCH COMMITTEE AND HERITAGE COLLEGE OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE RESEARCH COMMITTEE TO F.V.

MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO THIS COMPOUND HAS BEEN REPORTED TO INDUCE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION IN OFFSPRING, BUT THE EFFECT OF ITS PATERNAL EXPOSURE IS RARELY DISCUSSED. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED WHETHER PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL BPA EXPOSURE CAN AFFECT THE EMOTIONS OF MALE RATS AND THEIR OFFSPRING. EIGHTEEN ADULT MALE RATS (F0) RECEIVED EITHER A VEHICLE OR 50 G/KG/DAY BPA DIET FOR 21 WEEKS AND WERE THEN MATED WITH NON-EXPOSED FEMALES TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING (F1). THE AFFECTIVE BEHAVIORS OF F0 AND F1 RATS WERE EVALUATED IN THE OPEN-FIELD TEST, THE ELEVATED-PLUS MAZE AND THE FORCED SWIMMING TEST, AND THEIR SERUM CORTICOSTERONE WERE THEN EXAMINED. BPA EXPOSURE INDUCED INCREASED ANXIETY BEHAVIORS ALONG WITH INCREASED SERUM CORTICOSTERONE IN F0 RATS. THIS PATERNAL EXPOSURE ALSO LED TO INCREASED ANXIETY BEHAVIORS IN F1 FEMALES AND AGGRAVATED DEPRESSION BEHAVIORS IN BOTH SEXES OF F1 RATS. FURTHERMORE, ONLY F1 FEMALES EXHIBITED INCREASED SERUM CORTICOSTERONE. OVERALL, THESE DATA INDICATE THAT PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO A LOW DOSE OF BPA MAY INDUCE TRANSGENERATIONAL SEX-SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENTS IN THE AFFECTION OF ADULT RATS. 2018 FAN ET AL.

WHILE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED ON MATERNAL INFLUENCE, MUCH LESS IS KNOWN REGARDING THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL FACTORS. ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE (EMP) IS A SPECIAL AND WIDELY USED TYPE OF EMF. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL EMP EXPOSURE ON THE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINE FUNCTION OF THE MALE RAT OFFSPRING. MALE SPRAGUE DAWLEY RATS WERE RANDOMLY EXPOSED TO EMP AT 200 KV M1 FOR 0, 100 OR 400 PULSES BEFORE MATING. THE ADULT MALE OFFSPRING WERE SACRIFICED AND THE STRUCTURAL CHANGES OF TESTES, LEVELS OF SERUM STEROID HORMONES, SPERM CHARACTERISTICS, REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIORS, CONTENT OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINE-RELATED NEUROTRANSMITTER GABA AND EXPRESSION OF THE GABAA RECEPTOR WERE ANALYZED. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT PATERNAL EXPOSURE INDUCED A DECREASE OF TESTOSTERONE (T), SPERM QUANTITY AND ACROSIN ACTIVITY IN THE MALE OFFSPRING (P &LT; 0.05). IT DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE STRUCTURE OF TESTES, SPERM DEFORMITY FREQUENCY AND REPRODUCTIVE BEHAVIORS COMPARED WITH THE SHAM-EXPOSED GROUP. THE CONTENT OF GABA AND THE PROTEIN AND MRNA EXPRESSION OF THE HYPOTHALAMIC GABAA RECEPTOR PROTEIN INCREASED IN THE EMP EXPOSURE GROUP (P &LT; 0.05). IN CONCLUSION, OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT UNDER THESE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS EMP HAD A CERTAIN DEGREE OF INFLUENCE ON THE REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINE FUNCTION OF THE MALE RAT OFFSPRING, AND THE HYPOTHALAMIC GABAA RECEPTOR MAY BE INVOLVED IN THE REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY OF THE MALE OFFSPRING.

IN CHILDREN WHOSE FATHERS INITIATED ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT DURING PREGNANCY, RESULTS WERE SIMILAR FOR ALL OUTCOMES APART FROM INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY, WHICH HAD AN INCREASED ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIO (1.66 (1.06 TO 2.59)). COMPARED WITH THE 2033 CHILDREN WHOSE FATHERS INITIATED ANTIDEPRESSANT TREATMENT DURING PREGNANCY, THE 3983 CHILDREN EXPOSED TO PATERNAL USE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS AT CONCEPTION HAD NO DIFFERENCES IN PRETERM BIRTH, MALFORMATION, AND AUTISM, BUT A REDUCED RISK OF INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY (ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIO 0.49 (0.26 TO 0.93)). CONCLUSION: PATERNAL INTAKE OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS DURING THE PERIOD AROUND CONCEPTION IS SAFE WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK OF THE FOUR MAJOR ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN OFFSPRING - PRETERM BIRTH, MALFORMATION, AUTISM, OR INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY.

PHARMACOL.","DURING THE PAST DECADES, THE USE/MISUSE OF OPIOIDS HAS INCREASED DRAMATICALLY AMONG ADOLESCENT POPULATION. IT IS NOW WELL ACKNOWLEDGED THAT VARIOUS MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL CHANGES OCCUR IN THE BRAIN DURING ADOLESCENCE. DURING THIS CRITICAL PERIOD, BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND MATURATION COULD BE AFFECTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING STRESS, DRUG ABUSE, NUTRITIONAL STATUS, ETC. ALTHOUGH STUDIES ON TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF SUBSTANCES SUCH AS ALCOHOL, NICOTINE, AND COCAINE HAVE FOCUSED ON BOTH PATERNAL AND MATERNAL DRUG EXPOSURE, MOST REPORTS ON TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF MORPHINE ARE RESTRICTED TO MATERNAL EXPOSURE. THUS, IN THIS STUDY, WE AIMED TO INVESTIGATE THE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECT OF PATERNAL MORPHINE EXPOSURE DURING ADOLESCENCE ON PAIN PERCEPTION AND ANTINOCICEPTIVE EFFECT OF MORPHINE IN RAT OFFSPRING. MALE RATS RECEIVED ESCALATING DOSES OF MORPHINE FOR 10 DAYS DURING POSTNATAL DAYS 31-40. TWENTY DAYS AFTER THE LAST MORPHINE INJECTION, MALE RATS WERE MATED WITH INTACT FEMALE RATS, AND THEN BEHAVIORAL TESTS WERE CONDUCTED ON THE MALE OFFSPRING ON POSTNATAL DAY 60. PAIN PERCEPTION AND MORPHINE ANTINOCICEPTION WERE EVALUATED USING THE FORMALIN TEST. OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT MORPHINE-SIRED AND SALINE-SIRED ANIMALS DIFFERED IN THE INTERPHASE AND PHASE 2 OF THE FORMALIN TEST. THESE FINDINGS INDICATE A SIGNIFICANT TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECT OF PATERNAL MORPHINE EXPOSURE ON PAIN-RELATED BEHAVIORS IN RAT OFFSPRING. 2018 WOLTERS KLUWER HEALTH, INC.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS THIS MULTIGENERATIONAL, POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY OF FINNISH INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR SIBLINGS BORN BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 1933, AND DECEMBER 31, 1944, ANALYZED THE ASSOCIATION OF EVACUEE STATUS AS A CHILD DURINGWORLDWAR II IN THE FIRST GENERATION WITH THE RISK OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION AMONG OFFSPRING IN THE SECOND GENERATION. EVACUEE STATUS DURINGWORLDWAR II WAS DETERMINED USING THE FINNISH NATIONAL ARCHIVE'S REGISTRY OF PARTICIPANTS IN THE FINNISH EVACUATION. DATA ON EVACUEE STATUS WERE LINKED TO THE PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES IN THE FINNISH HOSPITAL DISCHARGE REGISTER FROM JANUARY 1, 1971, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2012, FOR OFFSPRING (N = 93 391) BORN BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 1950, AND DECEMBER 31, 2010. SEX-SPECIFIC COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE HAZARD RATIOS FOR RISK OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION DURING THE FOLLOW-UP PERIOD. BECAUSE OFFSPRING OF EVACUEES AND THEIR NONEVACUATED SIBLINGS ARE COUSINS, THE COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION MODELS INCLUDED FIXED EFFECTS TO ADJUST FOR CONFOUNDING FACTORS IN FAMILIES. DATA ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED FROM JUNE 15, 2016, TO AUGUST 26, 2017. EXPOSURES PARENTAL PARTICIPATION IN THE EVACUATION DURINGWORLDWAR II (CODED 1 FOR PARENTS WHO WERE EVACUATED AND PLACED IN FOSTER CARE AND 0 FOR THOSE NOT EVACUATED). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES OFFSPRING'S INITIAL ADMISSION TO THE HOSPITAL FOR A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER, OBTAINED FROM THE FINNISH HOSPITAL DISCHARGE REGISTER FROM JANUARY 1, 1971, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2012. RESULTS OF THE 93 391 STUDY PERSONS, 45 955 (49.2%) WERE WOMEN AND 47 436 (50.8) WERE MEN; MEAN (SD) AGE IN 2012 AMONG SURVIVORS WAS 45.4 (6.58) YEARS. FEMALE OFFSPRING OF MOTHERS EVACUATED TO SWEDEN DURING CHILDHOOD HAD AN ELEVATED RISK OF PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION (HAZARD RATIO FOR ANY TYPE OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER: 2.04 [95%CI, 1.04-4.01]; HAZARD RATIO FOR MOOD DISORDER: 4.68 [95%CI, 1.92-11.42]). THERE WAS NO EXCESS RISK OF BEING HOSPITALIZED FOR A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER AMONG WOMEN WHOSE FATHERS WERE EXPOSED TO THE FINNISH EVACUATION POLICY DURINGWORLDWAR II OR AMONG MEN WHOSE MOTHERS OR FATHERS WERE EXPOSED. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE IN A PRIOR FOLLOW-UP STUDY OF THE FINNISH EVACUEES, GIRLS EVACUATED TO SWEDISH FOSTER FAMILIES DURINGWORLDWAR II WERE MORE LIKELY TO BE HOSPITALIZED FOR A PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER-IN PARTICULAR, A MOOD DISORDER-IN ADULTHOOD THAN THEIR NONEVACUATED SISTERS. THE PRESENT STUDY FOUND THAT THE OFFSPRING OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WERE ALSO AT RISK FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THAT REQUIRED HOSPITALIZATION AND SUGGESTS THAT EARLY-LIFE ADVERSITIES, INCLUDING WAR-RELATED EXPOSURES, MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS THAT PERSIST ACROSS GENERATIONS.",NA,NA,NA,"SANTAVIRTA, T.; INSTITUTE FOR HOUSING AND URBAN RESEARCH, UPPSALA UNIVERSITY, SWEDISH INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH, PO BOX 256, SWEDEN; EMAIL: TORSTEN.SANTAVIRTA@IBF.UU.SE","ARTICLE","10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2017.3511","MICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTHMICHIGAN DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENTEUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH JOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTHJOHNS HOPKINS BLOOMBERG SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH HELSINGIN YLIOPISTOHELSINGIN YLIOPISTO EUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENTEUNICE KENNEDY SHRIVER NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CHILD HEALTH AND HUMAN DEVELOPMENT SIGNE JA ANE GYLLENBERGIN STISIGNE JA ANE GYLLENBERGIN STI WILHELM OCH ELSE STOCKMANNS STIFTELSEWILHELM OCH ELSE STOCKMANNS STIFTELSE","2168622X","JAMA PSYCHIATRY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,11,"1",NA,"21-27","AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION",NA,"SCOPUS","ASSOCIATION OF THE WORLD WAR II FINNISH EVACUATION OF CHILDREN WITH PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALIZATION IN THE NEXT GENERATION",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040449211&doi=10.1001%2fjamapsychiatry.2017.3511&partnerID=40&md5=b10a246464f9ceee864c8c1bead811cc","75",2018,"HOUSING AND URBAN RESEARCH, UPPSALA UNIVERSITY AND SWEDISH INSTITUTE FOR SOCIAL RESEARCH, STOCKHOLM UNIVERSITY, UPPSALA, SWEDEN (T.

OUR GOAL WAS TO EXAMINE WHETHER PATERNAL SSRI USE BEFORE CONCEPTION INCREASES THE RISK OF ADHD IN OFFSPRING. METHODS: ON THE BASIS OF DANISH NATIONAL REGISTERS, WE CONDUCTED A COHORT STUDY OF 781 470 SINGLETONS BORN BETWEEN 1996 AND 2008 WITH FOLLOW-UP THROUGHOUT 2013. THE CHILDREN WHOSE FATHERS USED SSRIS DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE EXPOSED. COX REGRESSION WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THE HAZARD RATIO (HR) OF ADHD. RESULTS: A TOTAL OF 7216 CHILDREN (0.92%) WERE BORN TO FATHERS WHO HAD USED SSRIS DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION. THERE WERE 12 520 CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH ADHD. COMPARED WITH UNEXPOSED CHILDREN, THE EXPOSED HAD A 26% INCREASED RISK OF ADHD (HR = 1.26, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI]: 1.06-1.51) AFTER ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS. WHEN EXTENDING THE EXPOSURE WINDOW TO 1 YEAR BEFORE CONCEPTION, PATERNAL USE OF SSRIS ONLY DURING THE PERIOD OF 12 TO 3 MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HR OF 1.35 (95% CI: 1.10-1.66), WHEREAS PATERNAL USE OF SSRIS ONLY DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A SIMILARLY INCREASED RISK OF ADHD (ADJUSTED HR = 1.31, 95% CI: 0.95-1.82). CONCLUSIONS: THE MILDLY INCREASED RISK OF ADHD IN OFFSPRING ASSOCIATED WITH PATERNAL SSRI USE BEFORE CONCEPTION COULD PROBABLY BE DUE TO THE UNDERLYING INDICATIONS RELATED TO SSRI USE.

DESIGN A POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY. METHODS WE CONDUCTED A COHORT STUDY OF 669 922 CHILDREN BORN FROM 1998 TO 2008, WITH FOLLOW-UP THROUGHOUT 2013. BASED ON DANISH NATIONAL REGISTERS, WE LINKED INFORMATION ON PATERNAL USE OF SSRIS, ASD DIAGNOSED IN CHILDREN AND A RANGE OF POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS. THE CHILDREN WHOSE FATHERS USED SSRIS DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION WERE IDENTIFIED AS THE EXPOSED. COX REGRESSION MODEL WAS USED TO ESTIMATE THE HR FOR ASD IN CHILDREN. RESULTS COMPARED WITH UNEXPOSED CHILDREN, THE EXPOSED HAD A 1.62-FOLD HIGHER RISK OF ASD (95% CI 1.33 TO 1.96) AND THE RISK ATTENUATED AFTER ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS, ESPECIALLY FATHERS' PSYCHIATRIC CONDITIONS (HR=1.43, 95% CI 1.18 TO 1.74). WHEN EXTENDING THE EXPOSURE WINDOW TO 1 YEAR BEFORE CONCEPTION, THE INCREASED RISK PERSISTED IN CHILDREN OF FATHERS USING SSRIS ONLY FROM THE LAST YEAR UNTIL THE LAST 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION (HR=1.54, 95% CI 1.21 TO 1.94) BUT NOT IN CHILDREN OF FATHERS USING SSRIS ONLY DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION (HR=1.17, 95% CI 0.75 TO 1.82). WE ALSO PERFORMED STRATIFIED ANALYSES ACCORDING TO PATERNAL HISTORY OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS AND OBSERVED NO INCREASED ASD RISK AMONG CHILDREN WHOSE FATHER HAD AFFECTIVE DISORDERS. BESIDES, THE SIBLING ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT THE ASD RISK DID NOT INCREASE AMONG EXPOSED CHILDREN COMPARED WITH THEIR UNEXPOSED SIBLINGS. CONCLUSIONS THE MILDLY INCREASED RISK OF ASD IN THE OFFSPRING ASSOCIATED WITH PATERNAL SSRI USE BEFORE CONCEPTION MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATERNAL UNDERLYING PSYCHIATRIC INDICATIONS RELATED TO SSRI USE OR OTHER UNMEASURED CONFOUNDING FACTORS. 2017 ARTICLE AUTHOR(S).","E016368","CITALOPRAM, 59729-33-8; ESCITALOPRAM, 128196-01-0, 219861-08-2; FLUOXETINE, 54910-89-3, 56296-78-7, 59333-67-4; FLUVOXAMINE, 54739-18-3; PAROXETINE, 61869-08-7; SERTRALINE, 79617-96-2; SEROTONIN UPTAKE INHIBITORS",NA,"LIANG, H.; KEY LABORATORY OF REPRODUCTION REGULATION OF NPFPC, SIPPR, FUDAN UNIVERSITYCHINA; EMAIL: LUCYLHCN@163.COM","ARTICLE","10.1136/bmjopen-2017-016368","NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM)NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM),2016YFC1000505 DET FRIE FORSKNINGSRDDET FRIE FORSKNINGSRD,DFF-6110-00019 KAREN ELISE JENSENS FONDKAREN ELISE JENSENS FOND 176673,186200 EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCILEUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL,ERC-2010-STG-260242-PROGEURO LUNDBECKFONDENLUNDBECKFONDEN NOVO NORDISK FONDENNOVO NORDISK FONDEN NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA,81428011 2013-41-2569","20446055","BMJ OPEN","ENGLISH",NA,NA,3,"12",NA,NA,"BMJ PUBLISHING GROUP","29275337","SCOPUS","RISK OF AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER IN OFFSPRING FOLLOWING PATERNAL USE OF SELECTIVE SEROTONIN REUPTAKE INHIBITORS BEFORE CONCEPTION: A POPULATION-BASED COHORT STUDY",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048413618&doi=10.1136%2fbmjopen-2017-016368&partnerID=40&md5=a6a0bc06a104f57a54e636e72ef5ae6c","7",2017,"FUNDING THE STUDY WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (81428011), THE NATIONAL KEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF CHINA (2016YFC1000505), THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL (ERC-2010-STG-260242-PROGEURO), THE NORDIC CANCER UNION (176673, 186200), THE DANISH COUNCIL FOR INDEPENDENT RESEARCH (DFF-6110-00019), THE KAREN ELISE JENSENS FOND (2016), AND THE PROGRAM FOR CLINICAL RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE (PROCRIN) ESTABLISHED BY THE LUNDBECK FOUNDATION AND THE NOVO NORDISK FOUNDATION.

TO PROVIDE OUTCOME DATA CONCERNING PREGNANCIES EXPOSED TO THE INTERLEUKIN-1 (IL-1) INHIBITORS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION IN BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, DURING PREGNANCY AND BREAST FEEDING. METHODS. RETROSPECTIVE DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM MEMBERS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR SYSTEMIC AUTOINFLAMMATORY DISEASES AND COLLATED IN A SINGLE CENTRE. A UNIFORM DATA COLLECTION SHEET WAS USED TO OBTAIN STANDARDIZED DATA INCLUDING MATERNAL AGE AND DIAGNOSIS, TYPE, DURATION OF AND RESPONSE TO IL-1 BLOCKADE, PREGNANCY DURATION, DELIVERY, MODE OF FEEDING AND NEONATAL DEVELOPMENT. RESULTS. THERE WERE 31 MATERNAL-EXPOSED PREGNANCIES FROM SEVEN COUNTRIES AND WE REPORT THE FIRST DATA ON PATERNAL EXPOSURE: SIX TO ANAKINRA AND FIVE TO CANAKINUMAB, WITH NO NEGATIVE OUTCOMES. WE ALSO REPORT THE FIRST DATA ON CANAKINUMAB-EXPOSED PREGNANCIES: EIGHT PREGNANCIES THAT RESULTED IN THE DELIVERY OF SEVEN HEALTHY INFANTS OF NORMAL GESTATIONAL AGE AND BIRTHWEIGHT. THERE WERE 23 ANAKINRA-EXPOSED PREGNANCIES RESULTING IN THE BIRTH OF 21 HEALTHY INFANTS, AND ONE BABY WITH UNILATERAL RENAL AGENESIS AND ECTOPIC NEUROHYPOPHYSIS. THERE WERE TWO FIRST TRIMESTER MISCARRIAGES AFFECTING A MOTHER WITH ACTIVE DISEASE. THERE WERE NO SERIOUS NEONATAL INFECTIONS. FOURTEEN INFANTS WERE BREAST FED WITH NO COMPLICATIONS. THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY, WITH FOLLOW-UP OF UP TO 10 YEARS (MEDIAN 18 MONTHS). CONCLUSION. THIS SERIES SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES THE PUBLISHED EXPERIENCE OF IL-1 BLOCKADE AND REPRODUCTION INCLUDING THE FIRST DATA ON CANAKINUMAB AND ON PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO THESE AGENTS. DATA ARE GENERALLY REASSURING, ALTHOUGH THE CASE OF RENAL AGENESIS IS THE SECOND REPORTED IN AN ANAKINRA-EXPOSED PREGNANCY. THE AUTHOR 2017.

PREVIOUS REPORTS INDICATE THAT PATERNAL EXPERIENCES INCREASE PHENOTYPIC HETEROGENEITY AND MAY CONTRIBUTE TO OFFSPRING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO POST-CONCUSSIVE SYMPTOMOLOGY. THIS STUDY SOUGHT TO DETERMINE IF EPIGENETIC TAGS, SPECIFICALLY DNA METHYLATION OF PROMOTER REGIONS, ARE TRANSMITTED FROM RODENT FATHERS TO THEIR SONS. USING METHYLIGHT, PROMOTER METHYLATION OF SPECIFIC GENES INVOLVED IN RECOVERY FROM CONCUSSION AND BRAIN PLASTICITY WERE ANALYZED IN SPERM AND BRAIN TISSUE. PROMOTER METHYLATION IN SPERM DIFFERED BASED ON PATERNAL EXPERIENCE. DIFFERENCES IN METHYLATION WERE OFTEN IDENTIFIED IN BOTH THE SPERM AND BRAIN TISSUE OBTAINED FROM THEIR SONS, DEMONSTRATING TRANSMISSION OF EPIGENETIC TAGS. FOR CERTAIN GENES, METHYLATION IN THE SPERM WAS ALTERED FOLLOWING A CONCUSSION SUGGESTING THAT A HISTORY OF BRAIN INJURY MAY INFLUENCE PATERNAL TRANSMISSION OF TRAITS. AS TELOMERE LENGTH IS PATERNALLY INHERITED AND LINKED TO NEUROLOGICAL HEALTH, THIS STUDY EXAMINED PATERNALLY DERIVED DIFFERENCES IN TELOMERE LENGTH, IN BOTH SPERM AND BRAIN. TELOMERE LENGTH WAS CONSISTENT BETWEEN FATHERS AND THEIR SONS, AND BETWEEN BRAIN AND SPERM, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE OLDER FATHERS. OLDER FATHERS EXHIBITED INCREASED SPERM TELOMERE LENGTH, WHICH WAS NOT EVIDENT IN SPERM OR BRAIN OF THEIR SONS. 2017 THE AUTHOR(S).","7784",NA,NA,"MYCHASIUK, R.; ALBERTA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL RESEARCH INSTITUTE, HOTCHKISS BRAIN INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGYCANADA; EMAIL: RMMYCHAS@UCALGARY.CA","ARTICLE","10.1038/s41598-017-07784-7",NA,"20452322","SCIENTIFIC REPORTS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,2,"1",NA,NA,"NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","28769086","SCOPUS","INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF PATERNAL EPIGENETIC MARKS: MECHANISMS INFLUENCING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO POST-CONCUSSION SYMPTOMOLOGY IN A RODENT MODEL",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026848462&doi=10.1038%2fs41598-017-07784-7&partnerID=40&md5=3486f04a40175fb864560e19860bdb89","7",2017,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"HEHAR H, 2017, SCI REP","HEHAR H, 2017, SCI REP"

IN THE PRESENT STUDY, NICOTINE EXPOSURE INDUCED DEPRESSION IN THE PATERNAL GENERATION, BUT REDUCED DEPRESSION AND PROMOTED HYPERACTIVITY IN F1 OFFSPRING. WHILE THIS INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECT WAS NOT PASSED DOWN TO THE F2 GENERATION. FURTHER STUDIES REVEALED THAT NICOTINE INDUCED THE DOWN-REGULATION OF MMU-MIR-15B EXPRESSION DUE TO HYPER-METHYLATION IN THE CPG ISLAND SHORE REGION OF MMU-MIR-15B IN BOTH THE SPERMATOZOA OF F0 MICE AND THE BRAINS OF F1 MICE. AS THE TARGET GENE OF MMU-MIR-15B, WNT4 EXPRESSION WAS ELEVATED IN THE THALAMUS OF F1 MICE DUE TO THE INHERITANCE OF DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS FROM THE PATERNAL GENERATION. FURTHERMORE, THE INCREASED EXPRESSION OF WNT4 ELEVATED THE PHOSPHORYLATION LEVEL OF ITS DOWNSTREAM PROTEIN GSK-3 THROUGH THE CANONICAL WNT4 PATHWAY WHICH INVOLVED IN THE BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS OBSERVED IN F1 MICE. MOREOVER, IN VIVO STEREOTAXIC BRAIN INJECTIONS WERE USED TO INDUCE THE OVEREXPRESSION OF MMU-MIR-15B AND WNT4 AND CONFIRM THE NEUROBEHAVIORAL EFFECTS IN VITRO.

COLLECTIVELY, THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT PATERNAL COCAINE EXPOSURE PRODUCES EPIGENETIC REMODELING IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS LEADING TO NMDA RECEPTOR-DEPENDENT MEMORY FORMATION AND SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY IMPAIRMENTS ONLY IN MALE PROGENY, WHICH HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE MALE DESCENDANTS OF CHRONIC COCAINE USERS. 2017 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.

PMI","EPIGENETICS","THE PRECONCEPTION ENVIRONMENT IS A SIGNIFICANT MODIFIER OF DYSGENESIS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENVIRONMENTALLY-INDUCED DISEASE. TO DATE, FETAL ALCOHOL SPECTRUM DISORDERS (FASDS) HAVE BEEN EXCLUSIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH MATERNAL EXPOSURES, YET EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS MALE-INHERITED ALTERATIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAM OF SPERM MAY BE RELEVANT TO THE GROWTH-RESTRICTION PHENOTYPES OF THIS CONDITION. USING A MOUSE MODEL OF VOLUNTARY CONSUMPTION, WE FIND CHRONIC PRECONCEPTION MALE ETHANOL EXPOSURE ASSOCIATES WITH FETAL GROWTH RESTRICTION, DECREASED PLACENTAL EFFICIENCY, ABNORMALITIES IN CHOLESTEROL TRAFFICKING, SEX-SPECIFIC ALTERATIONS IN THE GENETIC PATHWAYS REGULATING HEPATIC FIBROSIS, AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE REGULATION OF IMPRINTED GENES. ALTERATIONS IN THE DNA METHYLATION PROFILES OF IMPRINTED LOCI HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN CLINICAL STUDIES OF ALCOHOLIC SPERM, SUGGESTING THE LEGACY OF PATERNAL DRINKING MAY TRANSMIT VIA HERITABLE DISRUPTIONS IN THE REGULATION OF IMPRINTED GENES. HOWEVER, THE CAPACITY OF SPERM-INHERITED CHANGES IN DNA METHYLATION TO BROADLY TRANSMIT ENVIRONMENTALLY-INDUCED PHENOTYPES REMAINS UNCONFIRMED. USING BISULPHITE MUTAGENESIS AND SECOND-GENERATION DEEP SEQUENCING, WE FIND NO EVIDENCE TO SUGGEST THAT THESE PHENOTYPES OR ANY OF THE ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPTIONAL CHANGES ARE LINKED TO ALTERATIONS IN THE SPERM-INHERITED DNA METHYLATION PROFILE. THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE CONSISTENT WITH RECENT STUDIES EXAMINING THE MALE TRANSMISSION OF DIET-INDUCED PHENOTYPES AND EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS OF PATERNAL INHERITANCE BEYOND DNA METHYLATION. THIS STUDY CHALLENGES THE SINGULAR IMPORTANCE OF MATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURES AND SUGGESTS PATERNAL ALCOHOL ABUSE IS A SIGNIFICANT, YET OVERLOOKED EPIDEMIOLOGICAL FACTOR COMPLICIT IN THE GENESIS OF ALCOHOL-INDUCED GROWTH DEFECTS, AND MAY PROVIDE MECHANISTIC INSIGHT INTO THE FAILURE OF FASD CHILDREN TO THRIVE POSTNATALLY. 2017 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC.",NA,"ALCOHOL, 64-17-5; S ADENOSYLMETHIONINE, 29908-03-0, 485-80-3; ETHANOL",NA,"GOLDING, M.C.; DEPARTMENT OF VETERINARY PHYSIOLOGY & PHARMACOLOGY, COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, TEXAS A&M UNIVERSITYUNITED STATES; EMAIL: MGOLDING@CVM.TAMU.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1080/15592294.2017.1363952","COLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, TEXAS A AND M UNIVERSITYCOLLEGE OF VETERINARY MEDICINE AND BIOMEDICAL SCIENCES, TEXAS A AND M UNIVERSITY NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,1R21AA022484","15592294","EPIGENETICS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,6,"10",NA,"841-853","TAYLOR AND FRANCIS INC.","28816587","SCOPUS","DNA METHYLATION-INDEPENDENT GROWTH RESTRICTION AND ALTERED DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMMING IN A MOUSE MODEL OF PRECONCEPTION MALE ALCOHOL EXPOSURE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038033135&doi=10.1080%2f15592294.2017.1363952&partnerID=40&md5=ba9614cb8d57481b244f4ce045c52089","12",2017,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, GRANT 1R21AA022484.

METHODS THIS STUDY INCLUDED ALL CHILDREN BORN IN DENMARK FROM 1 JANUARY 1997 THROUGH 2013. EXPOSED COHORT: CHILDREN FATHERED BY MEN WHO USED AZA/6-MP (N = 735) OR MTX (N = 209) WITHIN THREE MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION; UNEXPOSED COHORT: CHILDREN FATHERED BY MEN WHO DID NOT USE AZA/6-MP/MTX (N = 1,056,524). OUTCOMES: MALIGNANCIES, AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDERS (ASD)/SCHIZOPHRENIA/PSYCHOSIS, AND ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD). RESULTS OUTCOMES: OF CHILDREN: AZA/6-MP EXPOSURE: ONE WITH LEUKEMIA (0.14%), ONE WITH ASD/SCHIZOPHRENIA (0.14%) AND THREE WITH ADHD (0.41%); MTX EXPOSURE: THREE WITH ADHD (1.4%). UNEXPOSED: 1710 WITH MALIGNANCIES (0.16%), 2107 WITH ASD/SCHIZOPHRENIA (0.20%), 2799 WITH ADHD (0.26%). MEDIAN FOLLOW UP TIMES WERE 6.7 [IQR:3.6-11.3] AND 9.9 [IQR:5.7-14.3] YEARS RESPECTIVELY.

IN THIS STUDY, WE COMPARED THE AMOUNT OF GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION IN SEEDS OF THE GYNODIOECIOUS PLANT GERANIUM SYLVATICUM IN RELATION TO THE GENDER AND THE AMF STATUS OF THE PARENTS PRODUCING THE SEEDS. THE AMOUNT OF DNA METHYLATED WAS POSITIVELY RELATED TO SEED MASS. SEEDS PRODUCED BY FEMALES HAD A SIMILAR PROPORTION OF METHYLATED DNA REGARDLESS OF THE AMF STATUS OF THE FATHER SIRING THE SEED. BY CONTRAST, SEEDS FROM HERMAPHRODITES HAD HIGHER DNA METHYLATION WHEN SIRED BY AMF FATHERS. WE SHOW TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE FOR THE FIRST TIME, THAT THE AMF STATUS OF FATHERS CAN AFFECT DNA METHYLATION IN SEEDS AND THAT THESE CHANGES IN DNA METHYLATION ARE FURTHER DEPENDENT ON THE GENDER OF THE MOTHER PRODUCING THE SEEDS. 2017 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY.

THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO CLARIFY WHETHER PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE (EMP) AFFECTS OFFSPRING SEX RATIO IN MICE. 50 MALE BALB/C MICE AGED 56 WEEKS WERE EXPOSED TO EMP DAILY FOR 2 WEEKS BEFORE MATED WITH NON-EXPOSED FEMALES AT 0D, 7D, 14D, 21D AND 28D AFTER EXPOSURE. SEX HORMONES INCLUDING TOTAL TESTOSTERONE, LH, FSH, AND GNRH WERE DETECTED USING RADIOIMMUNOASSAY. THE SEX RATIO WAS EXAMINED BY PCR AND AGAROSE GEL ELECTROPHORESIS. THE RESULTS OF D0, D21 AND D28 SHOWED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES COMPARED WITH SHAM-EXPOSED GROUPS. THE SERUM TESTOSTERONE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN D0, D14, D21, AND D28 COMPARED WITH SHAM-EXPOSED GROUPS (P<0.05).

MANY FACTORS HAVE BEEN IMPLICATED IN THE ETIOLOGY OF DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES ARE BEING INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED. THE INCREASE IN DEPRESSION RATES HAS COINCIDED WITH INCREASED ARTIFICIAL NIGHTTIME LIGHTING. EXPOSURE TO LIGHT AT NIGHT (LAN) HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED DEPRESSIVE-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN RODENTS AND DECREASED MOOD IN HUMANS. HOWEVER, RELATIVELY LITTLE IS KNOWN ON THE MULTIGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF DLAN ON AFFECT. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPOSED ADULT MALE AND FEMALE SIBERIAN HAMSTERS (PHODOPUS SUNGORUS) TO EITHER DARK (0LX) OR DIM LAN (5LX) FOR 9 WEEKS, THEN PAIRED ANIMALS IN A FULL FACTORIAL DESIGN; ALL ANIMALS WERE THEREAFTER HOUSED IN DARK NIGHTS. OFFSPRING WERE GESTATED AND REARED IN DARK NIGHTS, THEN TESTED IN ADULTHOOD FOR DEPRESSIVE-LIKE BEHAVIORS AND HIPPOCAMPAL EXPRESSION OF GLUCOCORTICOID (GR) AND MELATONIN (MT1) RECEPTOR EXPRESSION. MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO DLAN DECREASED SUCROSE PREFERENCE, TIME TO FIRST FLOAT BOUT IN THE PORSOLT SWIM TEST, AND GR EXPRESSION IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS. PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO DLAN INCREASED TIME SPENT FLOATING, AND INCREASED HIPPOCAMPAL GR EXPRESSION.

WE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED ON THE TRANSGENERATIONAL INFLUENCES OF INCREASED PATERNAL STRESS HORMONE LEVELS ON OFFSPRING ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION-RELATED BEHAVIORS. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER OFFSPRING SOCIABILITY AND COGNITION ARE ALSO INFLUENCED BY PATERNAL STRESS. ADULT C57BL/6J MALE MICE WERE TREATED WITH CORTICOSTERONE (CORT; 25MG/L) FOR FOUR WEEKS PRIOR TO PAIRED-MATINGS TO GENERATE F1 OFFSPRING. PATERNAL CORT TREATMENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED BODY WEIGHTS OF FEMALE OFFSPRING AND A MARKED REDUCTION OF THE MALE OFFSPRING. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOR OF ADULT F1 OFFSPRING IN THE THREE-CHAMBER SOCIAL INTERACTION TEST. DESPITE MALE OFFSPRING OF CORT-TREATED FATHERS DISPLAYING HYPERACTIVITY IN THE Y-MAZE, THERE WAS NO OBSERVABLE DIFFERENCE IN SHORT-TERM SPATIAL WORKING MEMORY. SPATIAL LEARNING AND MEMORY TESTING IN THE MORRIS WATER MAZE REVEALED THAT FEMALE, BUT NOT MALE, F1 OFFSPRING OF CORT-TREATED FATHERS HAD IMPAIRED MEMORY RETENTION. WE USED OUR RECENTLY DEVELOPED METHODOLOGY TO ANALYZE THE SPATIAL SEARCH STRATEGY OF THE MICE DURING THE LEARNING TRIALS AND DETERMINED THAT THE IMPAIRMENT COULD NOT BE ATTRIBUTED TO UNDERLYING DIFFERENCES IN SEARCH STRATEGY. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE EVIDENCE FOR THE IMPACT OF PATERNAL CORTICOSTERONE ADMINISTRATION ON OFFSPRING COGNITION AND COMPLEMENT THE CUMULATIVE KNOWLEDGE OF TRANSGENERATIONAL EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE OF ACQUIRED TRAITS IN RODENTS AND HUMANS. 2017 ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; CORTICOSTERONE; GLUCOCORTICOIDS","PSYCD","HANNAN, A.J.; FLOREY INSTITUTE OF NEUROSCIENCE AND MENTAL HEALTH, MELBOURNE BRAIN CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE, PARKVILLE, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: ANTHONY.HANNAN@FLOREY.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.05.014",NA,"03064530","PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,9,NA,NA,"9-18","ELSEVIER LTD","28554167","SCOPUS","ELEVATED PATERNAL GLUCOCORTICOID EXPOSURE MODIFIES MEMORY RETENTION IN FEMALE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85019955985&doi=10.1016%2fj.psyneuen.2017.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=c61c9e7cf64a006b035a607a39493dc8","83",2017,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA-IRVINE;UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE;NOTREPORTED",NA,"YESHURUN S, 2017, PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY","YESHURUN S, 2017, PSYCHONEUROENDOCRINOLOGY"

TWO COMMON QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS, ALKYLDIMETHYLBENZYL AMMONIUM CHLORIDE (ADBAC) AND DIDECYLDIMETHYL AMMONIUM CHLORIDE (DDAC), ARE COMBINED IN COMMON CLEANERS AND DISINFECTANTS. INTRODUCTION OF A CLEANER CONTAINING ADBAC+DDAC IN THE VIVARIUM CAUSED NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS (NTDS) IN MICE AND RATS. METHODS: TO FURTHER EVALUATE THIS FINDING, MALE AND FEMALE MICE WERE DOSED IN THE FEED AT 60 OR 120 MG/KG/DAY, OR BY ORAL GAVAGE AT 7.5, 15, OR 30 MG/KG ADBAC+DDAC. MICE ALSO RECEIVED AMBIENT EXPOSURE TO ADBAC+DDAC FROM THE DISINFECTANT USED IN THE MOUSE ROOM. EMBRYOS WERE EVALUATED ON GESTATIONAL DAY 10 FOR NTDS, AND FETUSES WERE EVALUATED ON GESTATIONAL DAY 18 FOR GROSS AND SKELETAL MALFORMATIONS. RESULTS: WE FOUND INCREASED NTDS WITH EXPOSURE TO ADBAC+DDAC IN BOTH RATS AND MICE. THE NTDS PERSISTED FOR TWO GENERATIONS AFTER CESSATION OF EXPOSURE. NOTABLY, MALE EXPOSURE ALONE WAS SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE NTDS. EQUALLY SIGNIFICANT, AMBIENT EXPOSURE FROM DISINFECTANT USE IN THE VIVARIUM, INFLUENCED THE LEVELS OF NTDS TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN ORAL DOSING. NO GROSS OR SIGNIFICANT AXIAL SKELETAL MALFORMATIONS WERE OBSERVED IN LATE GESTATION FETUSES. PLACENTAL ABNORMALITIES AND LATE GESTATION FETAL DEATHS WERE INCREASED AT 120 MG/KG/DAY, WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN THE LACK OF MALFORMATIONS OBSERVED IN LATE GESTATION FETUSES. CONCLUSION: THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT ADBAC+DDAC IN COMBINATION ARE TERATOGENIC TO RODENTS. GIVEN THE INCREASED USE OF THESE DISINFECTANTS, FURTHER EVALUATION OF THEIR SAFETY IN HUMANS AND THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO HEALTH AND DISEASE IS ESSENTIAL.

BRAIN RES.","RECENT RODENT STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT PARENTAL COCAINE EXPOSURE CAN INFLUENCE OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR, SUPPORTING THE IDEA THAT ENVIRONMENTAL INSULTS CAN IMPACT SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS. HOWEVER, STUDIES ON THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL COCAINE EXPOSURE ARE LIMITED AND MULTIPLE INCONSISTENCIES EXIST. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WE BEHAVIORALLY CHARACTERIZE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL COCAINE EXPOSURE IN A C57BL/6J INTERGENERATIONAL MOUSE MODEL. MALE SIRES WERE ADMINISTERED COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE (20MG/KG) OR SALINE (0.01ML/G) ONCE A DAY FOR 75DAYS, AND BRED WITH DRUG NAVE FEMALES TWENTY-FOUR HOURS AFTER THE FINAL INJECTION. OFFSPRING, SEPARATED BY SEX, WERE TESTED IN A BATTERY OF BEHAVIORS. WE FOUND THAT PATERNAL COCAINE EXPOSURE ALTERED SENSITIVITY TO THE REWARDING AND STIMULANT EFFECTS OF PSYCHOSTIMULANTS AND NATURAL REWARD (SUCROSE) IN FEMALE OFFSPRING; FEMALE COCAINE-SIRED OFFSPRING SHOWED BLUNTED COCAINE PREFERENCE USING COCAINE CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE (CPP) AT A LOW DOSE (5MG/KG), BUT DISPLAYED SIMILAR PREFERENCE AT A HIGHER DOSE (10MG/KG) COMPARED TO SALINE-SIRED CONTROLS. ADDITIONALLY, COCAINE-SIRED FEMALE OFFSPRING EXHIBITED HIGHER PSYCHOMOTOR SENSITIVITY TO COCAINE (10MG/KG) AND AMPHETAMINE (2MG/KG) AND CONSUMED MORE SUCROSE. COCAINE-SIRED MALES EXHIBITED INCREASED PSYCHOMOTOR EFFECTS OF COCAINE AND AMPHETAMINE. MALE OFFSPRING ALSO DISPLAYED AN ANXIETY-LIKE PHENOTYPE. NO EFFECT OF PATERNAL COCAINE EXPOSURE WAS OBSERVED ON DEPRESSIVE-LIKE, LEARNING AND MEMORY OR SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN MALE OR FEMALE OFFSPRING.

HOWEVER, LITERATURES AS TO TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE OF METABOLIC DYSFUNCTIONS THROUGH MALE LINEAGE ARE RELATIVELY SCARCE. IN THE CURRENT STUDY, WE AIMED TO EVALUATE INFLUENCES OF PATERNAL HYPERGLYCEMIA ON METABOLIC PHENOTYPES IN OFFSPRING. MALE SD RATS WERE I.P. INJECTED WITH STREPTOZOTOCIN (STZ) OR CITRATE BUFFER (CB, AS CONTROL). STZ-INJECTED RATS WITH GLUCOSE LEVELS HIGHER THAN 16.7 MM WERE SELECTED TO BREED WITH NORMAL FEMALE RATS. OFFSPRING FROM STZ OR CB TREATED FATHERS (STZ-O AND CB-O) WERE MAINTAINED IN THE IDENTICAL CONDITION. WE MONITORED BODY WEIGHT AND FOOD INTAKE, AND TESTS OF GLUCOSE AND INSULIN TOLERANCE (GTTS AND ITTS), FASTING-REFEEDING AND COLD EXPOSURE WERE PERFORMED. EXPRESSION OF FACTORS INVOLVED IN HYPOTHALAMIC FEEDING AND BROWN ADIPOSE TISSUE (BAT) THERMOGENIC ACTIVITY WAS PERFORMED BY REAL-TIME PCR AND WESTERN BLOT. ADULT STZ-O WERE HEAVIER THAN CB-O. IMPAIRMENT OF GTTS WAS OBSERVED IN STZ-O COMPARED WITH CB-O AT 22 AND 32 WEEKS OF AGE; ITTS RESULTS SHOWED DECREASED INSULIN SENSITIVITY IN STZ-O. DAILY FOOD INTAKE AND ACCUMULATED FOOD INTAKE DURING 12-H REFEEDING AFTER FASTING WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN STZ-O. UCP1 LEVELS WERE DOWNREGULATED IN BAT FROM STZ-O AT ROOM TEMPERATURE AND COLD EXPOSURE. FINALLY, STZ-O RATS SHOWED SUPPRESSED LEPTIN SIGNALING IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS AS EVIDENCED BY UPREGULATED SOCS3, REDUCED PHOSPHORYLATION OF STAT3, IMPAIRED PROCESSING POMC AND DECREASED -MSH PRODUCTION.

STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT BM CAN CAUSE MULTI-GENERATIONAL EFFECTS ON THE PITUITARY-ADRENAL-AXIS OF RATS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND FERTILITY OF MALE RATS (F2) WHOSE FATHERS (F1) WERE EXPOSED TO BM (0.1MG/KG) ON GESTATIONAL DAYS 12, 13, 18 AND 19. IN F2 RATS, THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BODY WEIGHTS OF THE BM-TREATED GROUP AT PND 1 AS WELL AS DELAYED ONSET OF PUBERTY, AND DECREASES IN FSH LEVELS, LEYDIG CELL VOLUME, SPERM NUMBER AND MOTILITY, SEMINAL VESICLE CONTRACTILITY AND EJACULATED VOLUME. FURTHERMORE, INCREASED SERUM LH LEVELS, SPERM DNA DAMAGE AND ABNORMAL MORPHOLOGY WERE OBSERVED, RESULTING IN REDUCED FERTILITY.

WHILE THE IMPACT OF CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL FACTORS SUCH AS TOXINS OR DIET ON THE FITNESS OF THE PARENTS AND THEIR OFFSPRING HAVE BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY, THE IMPORTANCE OF BEHAVIOURAL AND SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES HAS ONLY RECENTLY BEEN RECOGNISED. BEHAVIOURAL TRAITS SUCH AS PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS CAN BE RELATIVELY STABLE, AND PARTLY COMPRISE A GENETIC COMPONENT BUT WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE NON-GENETIC TRANSMISSION OF PLASTIC BEHAVIOURAL TRAITS FROM PARENTS TO OFFSPRING. WE INVESTIGATED THE RELATIVE EFFECT OF PERSONALITY AND OF SOCIAL DOMINANCE AS INDICATORS AT THE OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE PLASTICITY RANGE ON OFFSPRING BEHAVIOUR IN THE ZEBRAFISH (DANIO RERIO). WE ASSESSED MALE BOLDNESS, A BEHAVIOURAL TRAIT THAT HAS PREVIOUSLY BEEN SHOWN PREVIOUSLY TO POSSESS GENETIC UNDERPINNINGS, AND EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATED MALE SOCIAL STATUS TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE TWO TYPES OF BEHAVIOUR AND THEIR CORRELATION WITH OFFSPRING ACTIVITY. RESULTS: WE FOUND A CLEAR INTERACTION BETWEEN THE RELATIVELY STABLE AND PUTATIVE GENETIC EFFECTS BASED ON INHERITED DIFFERENCES IN PERSONALITY AND THE EXPERIMENTALLY INDUCED EPIGENETIC EFFECTS FROM CHANGES IN THE SOCIAL STATUS OF THE FATHER ON OFFSPRING ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT OFFSPRING BEHAVIOUR IS DETERMINED BY A COMBINATION OF PATERNAL PERSONALITY TRAITS AND ON-GENETIC EFFECTS DERIVED FROM THE SOCIAL STATUS OF THE FATHER. 2017 THE AUTHOR(S).","157",NA,NA,"ZAJITSCHEK, S.; SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF EAST ANGLIA, NORWICH RESEARCH PARK, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: SUSI.ZAJITSCHEK@GMAIL.COM","ARTICLE","10.1186/s12862-017-1005-0","EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCILEUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL WENNER-GREN FOUNDATIONWENNER-GREN FOUNDATION VETENSKAPSRDETVETENSKAPSRDET KNUT OCH ALICE WALLENBERGS STIFTELSEKNUT OCH ALICE WALLENBERGS STIFTELSE,102 2013.0072","14712148","BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,6,"1",NA,NA,"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.","28673261","SCOPUS","PATERNAL PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL STATUS INFLUENCE OFFSPRING ACTIVITY IN ZEBRAFISH",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85021690406&doi=10.1186%2fs12862-017-1005-0&partnerID=40&md5=f4d4dc43dcad0b12815744367f6f6707","17",2017,"SZ WAS SUPPORTED BY A GRANT FROM THE SVEN AND LILLY LAWSKI FOUNDATION, JH-R BY A GRANT FROM THE KNUT AND ALICE WALLENBERG FOUNDATION (102 2013.0072), FZ BY A GRANT FROM THE WENNER-GREN FOUNDATION, AND SI BY GRANTS FROM THE SWEDISH RESEARCH COUNCIL, THE EUROPEAN RESEARCH COUNCIL AND THE KNUT AND ALICE WALLENBERG FOUNDATION.

REPROD.","STUDY QUESTION: DO PATERNAL EXPOSURES TO FOLIC ACID DEFICIENT (FD), AND/OR FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTED (FS) DIETS, THROUGHOUT GERM CELL DEVELOPMENT ADVERSELY AFFECT MALE GERM CELLS AND CONSEQUENTLY OFFSPRING HEALTH OUTCOMES? SUMMARY ANSWER: MALE MICE EXPOSED OVER THEIR LIFETIMES TO BOTH FD AND FS DIETS SHOWED DECREASED SPERM COUNTS AND ALTERED IMPRINTED GENE METHYLATION WITH EVIDENCE OF TRANSMISSION OF ADVERSE EFFECTS TO THE OFFSPRING, INCLUDING INCREASED POSTNATAL-PREWEANING MORTALITY AND VARIABILITY IN IMPRINTED GENE METHYLATION. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: THERE IS INCREASING EVIDENCE THAT DISRUPTIONS IN MALE GERM CELL EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING ARE ASSOCIATED WITH OFFSPRING ABNORMALITIES AND INTERGENERATIONAL DISEASE. THE FETAL PERIOD IS THE CRITICAL TIME OF DNA METHYLATION PATTERN ACQUISITION FOR DEVELOPING MALE GERM CELLS AND AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF METHYL DONORS IS REQUIRED. IN ADDITION, DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS CONTINUE TO BE REMODELED DURING POSTNATAL SPERMATOGENESIS. PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT LIFETIME (PRENATAL AND POSTNATAL) FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY CAN ALTER THE SPERM EPIGENOME AND INCREASE THE INCIDENCE OF FETAL MORPHOLOGICAL ABNORMALITIES. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: FEMALE BALB/C MICE (F0) WERE PLACED ON ONE OF FOUR AMINO-ACID DEFINED DIETS FOR 4 WEEKS BEFORE PREGNANCY AND THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY AND LACTATION: FOLIC ACID CONTROL (CTRL; 2 MG/KG), 7-FOLD FOLIC ACID DEFICIENT (7FD; 0.3 MG/KG), 10-FOLD HIGH FS (10FS, 20 MG/KG) OR 20-FOLD HIGH FS (20FS, 40 MG/KG) DIETS. F1 MALES WERE WEANED TO THEIR RESPECTIVE PRENATAL DIETS TO ALLOW FOR DIET EXPOSURE DURING ALL WINDOWS OF GERMLINE EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING: THE ERASURE, RE-ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE PHASES. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTINGS, METHODS: F0 FEMALES WERE MATED WITH CHOW-FED MALES TO PRODUCE F1 LITTERS WHOSE GERM CELLS WERE EXPOSED TO THE DIETS THROUGHOUT EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT. F1 MALES WERE SUBSEQUENTLY MATED WITH CHOW-FED FEMALE MICE. TWO F2 LITTERS, UNEXPOSED TO THE EXPERIMENTAL DIETS, WERE GENERATED FROM EACH F1 MALE; ONE LITTER WAS COLLECTED AT EMBRYONIC DAY (E)18.5 AND ONE DELIVERED AND FOLLOWED POSTNATALLY. DNA METHYLATION AT A GLOBAL LEVEL AND AT THE DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED REGIONS OF IMPRINTED GENES (H19, IMPRINTED MATERNALLY EXPRESSED TRANSCRIPT (NON-PROTEIN CODING)-H19, SMALL NUCLEAR RIBONUCLEOPROTEIN POLYPEPTIDE N-SNRPN, KCNQ1 OPPOSITE STRAND/ANTISENSE TRANSCRIPT 1 (NON-PROTEIN CODING)-KCNQ1OT1, PATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENE 1-PEG1 AND PATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENE 3-PEG3) WAS ASSESSED BY LUMINOMETRIC METHYLATION ANALYSIS AND BISULFITE PYROSEQUENCING, RESPECTIVELY, IN F1 SPERM, F2 E18.5 PLACENTA AND F2 E18.5 BRAIN CORTEX. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: F1 MALES EXHIBITED LOWER SPERM COUNTS FOLLOWING LIFETIME EXPOSURE TO BOTH FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY AND THE HIGHEST DOSE OF FOLIC ACID SUPPLEMENTATION (20FS), (BOTH P < 0.05). POST-IMPLANTATION LOSSES WERE INCREASED AMONGST F2 E18.5 DAY LITTERS FROM 20FS EXPOSED F1 MALES (P < 0.05). F2 LITTERS DERIVED FROM BOTH 7FD AND 20FS EXPOSED F1 MALES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER POSTNATAL-PREWEANING PUP DEATH (BOTH P < 0.05). SPERM FROM 10FS EXPOSED MALES HAD INCREASED VARIANCE IN METHYLATION ACROSS IMPRINTED GENE H19, P < 0.05; INCREASED VARIANCE AT A FEW SITES WITHIN H19 WAS ALSO FOUND FOR THE 7FD AND 20FS GROUPS (P < 0.05). WHILE THE 20FS DIET RESULTED IN INTER-INDIVIDUAL ALTERATIONS IN METHYLATION ACROSS THE IMPRINTED GENES SNRPN AND PEG3 IN F2 E18.5 PLACENTA, 50% OF INDIVIDUAL SITES TESTED IN PEG1 AND/OR PEG3 WERE AFFECTED IN THE 7FD AND 10FS GROUPS. INTER-INDIVIDUAL ALTERATIONS IN PEG1 METHYLATION WERE FOUND IN F2 E18.5 DAY 10FS GROUP BRAIN CORTEX (P < 0.05). LARGE SCALE DATA: NOT APPLICABLE. LIMITATIONS REASONS FOR CAUTION: THE CAUSE OF THE INCREASE IN POSTNATAL-PREWEANING MORTALITY WAS NOT INVESTIGATED POSTMORTEM. FURTHER STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY AND SUPPLEMENTATION ON DEVELOPING MALE GERM CELLS. GENOME-WIDE DNA AND HISTONE METHYLOME STUDIES AS WELL AS GENE EXPRESSION STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE LINKS BETWEEN FOLIC ACID EXPOSURES, AN ALTERED GERM CELL EPIGENOME AND OFFSPRING OUTCOMES. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY PROVIDE FURTHER SUPPORT FOR PATERNALLY TRANSMITTED ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT BOTH FOLIC ACID DEFICIENCY AND HIGH DOSE SUPPLEMENTATION CAN BE DETRIMENTAL TO GERM CELL DEVELOPMENT AND REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS, IN PART BY ALTERING DNA METHYLATION IN SPERM.

EXPERIMENTAL DATA ALSO SUGGEST THAT SOME INDUCED EFFECTS PERSIST IN DESCENDANTS OF EXPOSED MALES. THESE MULTI- AND TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS ARE ASSUMED TO RESULT FROM EPIGENETIC CHANGES TO THE GERMLINE, BUT FEW STUDIES HAVE DIRECTLY ANALYZED GERM CELLS. TYPICALLY, STUDIES OF TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS HAVE INVOLVED EXPOSING ONE GENERATION AND MONITORING EFFECTS IN SUBSEQUENT UNEXPOSED GENERATIONS. THIS APPROACH, HOWEVER, HAS LIMITED HUMAN RELEVANCE, SINCE BOTH THE NUMBER AND VOLUME OF ESTROGENIC CONTAMINANTS HAS INCREASED STEADILY OVER TIME, INTENSIFYING RATHER THAN REDUCING OR ELIMINATING EXPOSURE. USING AN OUTBRED CD-1 MOUSE MODEL, AND A SENSITIVE AND QUANTITATIVE MARKER OF GERMLINE DEVELOPMENT, MEIOTIC RECOMBINATION, WE TESTED THE EFFECT OF SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OF EXPOSURE ON THE TESTIS. WE TARGETED THE GERMLINE DURING A NARROW, PERINATAL WINDOW USING ORAL EXPOSURE TO THE SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN, ETHINYL ESTRADIOL. A COMPLEX THREE GENERATION EXPOSURE PROTOCOL ALLOWED US TO COMPARE THE EFFECTS OF INDIVIDUAL, PATERNAL, AND GRANDPATERNAL (ANCESTRAL) EXPOSURE. OUR DATA INDICATE THAT MULTIPLE GENERATIONS OF EXPOSURE NOT ONLY EXACERBATE GERM CELL EXPOSURE EFFECTS, BUT ALSO INCREASE THE INCIDENCE AND SEVERITY OF REPRODUCTIVE TRACT ABNORMALITIES. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT MALE SENSITIVITY TO ENVIRONMENTAL ESTROGENS IS INCREASED BY SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OF EXPOSURE. 2017 HORAN ET AL.","E1006885","ETHINYLESTRADIOL, 57-63-6; ESTROGENS",NA,"HUNT, P.A.; SCHOOL OF MOLECULAR BIOSCIENCES, CENTER FOR REPRODUCTIVE BIOLOGY, WASHINGTON STATE UNIVERSITYUNITED STATES; EMAIL: PATHUNT@VETMED.WSU.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1371/journal.pgen.1006885","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,R01 HD083177,R37 HD21341","15537390","PLOS GENETICS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,5,"7",NA,NA,"PUBLIC LIBRARY OF SCIENCE","28727826","SCOPUS","GERMLINE AND REPRODUCTIVE TRACT EFFECTS INTENSIFY IN MALE MICE WITH SUCCESSIVE GENERATIONS OF ESTROGENIC EXPOSURE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026668889&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pgen.1006885&partnerID=40&md5=0178e76cd8135fd9a8b7ee641b78ce60","13",2017,"GRANT SUPPORT FOR THESE STUDIES WAS PROVIDED BY NIH GRANTS TO PAH (R01 HD083177 MALE GERMLINE DEVELOPMENT AND ESTROGENIC EXPOSURES) AND TH (R37 HD21341 A PROGRAM OF RESEARCH IN POPULATION CYTOGENETICS).

NORMAL DIET WAS SUPPLIED FOR NORMAL MATERNAL RATS AND HIGH-FAT DIET WAS SUPPLIED FOR OBESE MATERNAL RATS FOR A 12-WEEK PERIOD UNTIL MATING, AND THE SAME DIET FOR EACH GROUP CONTINUED THROUGHOUT PREGNANCY AND LACTATION PERIOD. MALE RATS IN THE EXERCISING GROUPS EXERCISED FOR A 12-WEEK PERIOD. SPATIAL LEARNING ABILITY WAS REDUCED IN THE MALE RAT PUPS BORN FROM THE OBESE MATERNAL RATS. EXPRESSIONS OF BRAIN-DERIVED NEURO-TROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) AND TYROSINE KINASE B RECEPTOR (TRKB) IN THE HIP-POCAMPUS WERE SUPPRESSED AND CELL PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS WERE REDUCED IN THE MALE RAT PUPS BORN FROM THE OBESE MATERNAL RATS. PATERNAL TREADMILL EXERCISE IMPROVED SPATIAL LEARN-ING ABILITY, INCREASED BDNF AND TRKB EXPRESSIONS, AND ENHANCED CELL PROLIFERATION AND DIFFERENTIATION IN THE MALE RAT PUPS BORN FROM THE OBESE MATERNAL RATS. IT CAN BE SUGGESTED THAT PATERNAL EXERCISE ENHANCES HIP-POCAMPAL NEUROPLASTICITY AND CONSEQUENTLY IMPROVED SPATIAL LEARNING ABILITY IN THE RAT PUPS BORN FROM THE OBESE MATERNAL RATS. 2017 KOREAN SOCIETY OF EXERCISE REHABILITATION.",NA,NA,NA,"KIM, T.-W.; DEPARTMENT OF PHYSIOLOGY, COLLEGE OF MEDICINE, KYUNG HEE UNIVERSITY, 26 KYUNGHEEDAE-RO, SOUTH KOREA; EMAIL: TWKIM0806@NAVER.COM","ARTICLE","10.12965/jer.1734998.499","KOREAN ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCESKOREAN ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH NRF-2014S1 A5B5A07041321 NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREANATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREA,NRF","2288176X","JOURNAL OF EXERCISE REHABILITATION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,5,"3",NA,"266-272","KOREAN SOCIETY OF EXERCISE REHABILITATION",NA,"SCOPUS","PATERNAL PHYSICAL EXERCISE IMPROVES SPATIAL LEARNING ABILITY BY ENHANCING HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROPLASTICITY IN MALE PUPS BORN FROM OBESE MATERNAL RATS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85043756026&doi=10.12965%2fjer.1734998.499&partnerID=40&md5=35f4567d3d1f966f88fc7b0ae915a238","13",2017,"ALL ANIMAL EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES CONFORMED TO THE REGULATIONS STIPULATED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND THE GUIDELINES OF THE KOREAN ACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCE.

THE POTENTIAL ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING PROPERTIES OF CERTAIN SOLVENTS MAY INTERFERE WITH THE MALE GENITAL DEVELOPMENT IN UTERO. OBJECTIVES: WE AIMED TO ASSESS THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES TO ORGANIC SOLVENTS DURING THE PRENATAL PERIOD AND TGCT RISK IN THEIR OFFSPRING. METHODS: THIS REGISTRY-BASED CASE CONTROL STUDY INCLUDED TGCT CASES AGED 1449 Y (N = 8,112) DIAGNOSED FROM 1978 TO 2012 IN FINLAND, NORWAY, AND SWEDEN. CONTROLS (N = 26,264) WERE RANDOMLY SELECTED FROM THE CENTRAL POPULATION REGISTRIES AND WERE INDIVIDUALLY MATCHED TO CASES ON YEAR AND COUNTRY OF BIRTH. OCCUPATIONAL HISTORIES OF PARENTS PRIOR TO THE CHILDS BIRTH WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE NATIONAL CENSUSES. JOB CODES WERE CONVERTED INTO SOLVENT EXPOSURE USING THE NORDIC JOB-NORDIC OCCUPATIONAL CANCER STUDY JOB-EXPOSURE MATRIX. CONDITIONAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION WAS USED TO ESTIMATE ODDS RATIOS (OR) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CI). RESULTS: OVERALL, NO ASSOCIATION WAS FOUND BETWEEN PRENATAL MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS AND TGCT RISK. IN SUBSET ANALYSES USING ONLY MOTHERS FOR WHOM OCCUPATIONAL INFORMATION WAS AVAILABLE IN THE YEAR OF OR IN THE YEAR PRIOR TO THE CHILDS BIRTH, THERE WAS AN ASSOCIATION WITH MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO AROMATIC HYDROCARBON SOLVENTS (ARHC) (OR = 1:53; CI: 1.08, 2.17), DRIVEN BY EXPOSURE TO TOLUENE (OR = 1:67; CI: 1.02, 2.73). NO ASSOCIATION WAS SEEN FOR ANY PATERNAL OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPOSURE TO PERCHLOROETHYLENE IN FINLAND (OR = 2:42; CI: 1.32, 4.41). CONCLUSIONS: THIS STUDY SUGGESTS A MODEST INCREASE IN TGCT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MATERNAL PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO ARHC. 2017, PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, US DEPT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

MED. J. MALAYSIA.","BACKGROUND: EXPOSURE TO CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE (CPA) FOR CANCER TREATMENT RESULTS IN OVER-PRODUCTION OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES CAUSES OXIDATIVE STRESS THUS AFFECTING THE DNA IN MALE GERM CELL INDUCING SPERM DEFECTS. OUR GOAL IS TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF NIGELLA SATIVA EXTRACT (NSE) AND THYMOQUINONE (TQ) ON SPERM AND EMBRYO QUALITY FOLLOWING FERTLIZATION OF SPERM PRODUCED FROM GERM CELLS WHICH HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE DAMAGING ALKYLATING EFFECTS OF CPA. METHODS: THIRTY MALE ICR MICE WERE DIVIDED INTO SIX GROUPS; (I) VEHICLE-TREATED CONTROL (NORMAL SALINE), (II) CPA-ONLY, (III) TQ-ONLY, (IV) NSE-ONLY, (V) CPA FOLLOWED BY TQ AND (VI) CPA FOLLOWED BY NSE. TREATMENT WITH 200MG/KG CPA AND 10MG/KG OF BOTH NSE AND TQ WERE GIVEN BY INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTION. ANIMALS WERE SACRIFICED AT 33 DAYS BY CERVICAL DISLOCATION AND SPERM FROM CAUDAL EPIDYDYMIS WERE TAKEN FOR ANALYSIS AND IN VITRO FERTILIZATION (IVF) WITH EGGS FROM UNTREATED FEMALE. FERTILIZATION RATES AND EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT WERE MONITORED FOR 5 DAYS. THE RESULT WERE ANALYSED BY USING SPSS 16.RESULTS: TQ AND NSE SUPPLEMENTATION TO CPA-EXPOSED MALE MICE HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT (P > 0.05) ON THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SPERM IF COMPARED TO CPA-ONLY EXPOSED MICE. NSE AND TQ SUPPLEMENTATION HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT (P < 0.05) ON THE PERCENTAGE OF MOTILE SPERM AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF ABNORMAL SPERM. FOUR TYPES OF ABNORMALITIES OF THE SPERM WERE FOUND WHICH INCLUDES FOLDED SPERM, AMORPHOUS, BANANA-LIKE AND THE HEAD LACKING OF THE USUAL HOOK. FINALLY, THE EMBRYO QUALITY SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT BY THE SUPPLEMENTATION OF TQ AND NSE TO CPA-EXPOSED MALE MICE (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: OVERALL, BOTH NSE AND TQ HAVE INDICATED CHEMOPREVENTIVE POTENTIAL AGAINST THE CYTOTOXICITY OF CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE ON THE REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND FERTILITY.",NA,NA,NA,"RAHMAN, S.A.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE, FACULTY OF ALLIED HEALTH SCIENCES, INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY MALAYSIA, JALAN SULTAN AHMAD SHAH, MALAYSIA; EMAIL: SUZANAHRAHMAN@YAHOO.COM","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"18234631","INTERNATIONAL MEDICAL JOURNAL MALAYSIA","ENGLISH",NA,NA,1,"1",NA,"99-106","INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY MALAYSIA",NA,"SCOPUS","INVESTIGATING THE POTENTIAL OF NIGELLA SATIVA AND THYMOQUINONE IN SALVAGING THE EMBRYO FROM EFFECTS OF TOXIC PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85020072549&partnerID=40&md5=cec3e774a2df65e513d684107f536a30","16",2017,"NA NA NA","INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY MALAYSIA;CYBERJAYA UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES","NOTREPORTED;INTERNATIONAL ISLAMIC UNIVERSITY MALAYSIA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"RAHMAN SA, 2017, INT MED J MALAYSIA","RAHMAN SA, 2017, INT MED J MALAYSIA"

WHILE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATERNAL DIET, OFFSPRING GROWTH AND ADULT DISEASE RISK IS WELL-ESTABLISHED, THE EFFECT OF FATHER'S DIET ON OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. THEREFORE, WE FED MALE MICE AN IMBALANCED LOW PROTEIN DIET (LPD) TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT ON POST-FERTILISATION DEVELOPMENT AND FETAL GROWTH. WE OBSERVED THAT IN PREIMPLANTATION EMBRYOS DERIVED FROM LPD FED MALES, EXPRESSION OF MULTIPLE GENES WITHIN THE CENTRAL METABOLIC AMPK PATHWAY WAS REDUCED. IN LATE GESTATION, PATERNAL LPD PROGRAMMED INCREASED FETAL WEIGHT, HOWEVER, PLACENTAL WEIGHT WAS REDUCED, RESULTING IN AN ELEVATED FETAL:PLACENTAL WEIGHT RATIO. ANALYSIS OF GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS REVEALED INCREASED LEVELS OF TRANSPORTERS FOR CALCIUM, AMINO ACIDS AND GLUCOSE WITHIN LPD PLACENTAS. FURTHERMORE, PLACENTAL EXPRESSION OF THE EPIGENETIC REGULATORS DNMT1 AND DNMT3L WERE INCREASED ALSO, COINCIDING WITH ALTERED PATTERNS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL IMPRINTED GENES. MORE STRIKINGLY, WE OBSERVED FETAL SKELETAL DEVELOPMENT WAS PERTURBED IN RESPONSE TO PATERNAL LPD. HERE, WHILE OFFSPRING OF LPD FED MALES POSSESSED LARGER SKELETONS, THEIR BONES COMPRISED LOWER VOLUMES OF HIGH MINERAL DENSITY IN COMBINATION WITH REDUCED MATURITY OF BONE APATITE.

DEV. ORIG. HEALTH DIS.","MOST NUTRITIONAL STUDIES ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF CHILDREN FOCUS ON MOTHER-INFANT INTERACTIONS. MATERNAL NUTRITION IS CRITICALLY INVOLVED IN THE GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE FETUS, BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FATHER? THE AIM IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL METHYL-GROUP DONOR INTAKE (METHIONINE, FOLATE, BETAINE, CHOLINE) ON PATERNAL AND OFFSPRING GLOBAL DNA (HYDROXY)METHYLATION, OFFSPRING IGF2 DMR DNA METHYLATION, AND BIRTH WEIGHT. QUESTIONNAIRES, 7-DAY ESTIMATED DIETARY RECORDS, WHOLE BLOOD SAMPLES, AND ANTHROPOMETRIC MEASUREMENTS FROM 74 FATHERS WERE OBTAINED. A TOTAL OF 51 CORD BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED AND BIRTH WEIGHT WAS OBTAINED. DNA METHYLATION STATUS WAS MEASURED USING LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY-TANDEM MASS SPECTROMETRY (GLOBAL DNA (HYDROXY)METHYLATION) AND PYROSEQUENCING (IGF2 DMR METHYLATION). PATERNAL BETAINE INTAKE WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH PATERNAL GLOBAL DNA HYDROXYMETHYLATION (0.028% PER 100 MG BETAINE INCREASE, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.053, P=0.03) AND CORD BLOOD GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION (0.679% PER 100 MG BETAINE INCREASE, 95% CI: 0.057, 1.302, P=0.03). PATERNAL METHIONINE INTAKE WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH CPG1 (0.336% PER 100 MG METHIONINE INCREASE, 95% CI: 0.103, 0.569, P=0.006), AND MEAN CPG (0.201% PER 100 MG METHIONINE INCREASE, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.402, P=0.049) METHYLATION OF THE IGF2 DMR IN CORD BLOOD. FURTHER, A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN BIRTH WEIGHT/BIRTH WEIGHT-FOR-GESTATIONAL AGE Z-SCORE AND PATERNAL BETAINE/METHIONINE INTAKE WAS FOUND. IN ADDITION, A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CHOLINE AND BIRTH WEIGHT/BIRTH WEIGHT-FOR-GESTATIONAL AGE Z-SCORE WAS ALSO OBSERVED. OUR DATA INDICATE A POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PATERNAL METHYL-GROUP DONOR INTAKE ON PATERNAL GLOBAL DNA HYDROXYMETHYLATION, OFFSPRING GLOBAL AND IGF2 DMR DNA METHYLATION, AND PRENATAL GROWTH.

BRAIN RES.","MANY STUDIES HAVE BEEN SHOWN THAT MATERNAL STRESS DURING PREGNANCY AND IN EARLY LIFE PERIOD INFLUENCES OFFSPRING IN THE BEHAVIORAL AND MOLECULAR ASPECTS IN HUMAN AND ANIMAL MODELS. RECENT RESEARCH HAS INDICATED THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITION OF MALES BEFORE CONCEPTION HAS EFFECTS ON NEXT GENERATIONS. WE EVALUATED WHETHER PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL STRESS (PPS) COULD INFLUENCE ON HIPPOCAMPAL GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR GENE (GR), (NR3C1) EXPRESSION, CORTICOSTERONE RESPONSE AND BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES OF THEIR OFFSPRING. FOR THIS PURPOSE, ADULT MALE RATS WERE SUBJECTED TO DAILY 10MIN SESSION OF FORCED SWIMMING FOR 21 CONSECUTIVE DAYS. THEN, TWO PARENTAL BREEDING GROUPS WERE FORMED: STRESSED FATHER (SF) AND NON-STRESSED FATHER (NSF) OR CONTROL GROUP. 30-DAY-OLD PUPS WERE TESTED FOR ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR BY USING THE ELEVATED PLUS MAZE (EPM). SERUM CORTICOSTERONE LEVEL WAS ALSO MEASURED BY ELISA. HIPPOCAMPAL NR3C1 DNA METHYLATION, GENE AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION WERE RESPECTIVELY ASSAYED BY METHYLATION SENSITIVE RESTRICTION ENZYMES (REAL TIME PCR), REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE PCR (RT-PCR) AND WESTERN-BLOTTING IN ALL GROUPS. MORE ANXIETY-RELATED BEHAVIOR, SERUM CORTICOSTERONE CONCENTRATION, DNA METHYLATION LEVELS OF NR3C1 AND LOWER EXPRESSION OF THIS GENE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY OBSERVED IN PATERNALLY STRESSED PUPS COMPARED TO CONTROL PUPS. AS WELL, MOLECULAR CHANGES WERE MORE PRONOUNCED IN MALE PUPS COMPARED TO FEMALE PUPS. OUR RESULTS REVEALED THAT PATERNAL STRESS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION HAS A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON MOLECULAR, HORMONAL AND BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES IN THEIR OFFSPRING. 2017 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; CORTICOSTERONE; NR3C1 PROTEIN, RAT; RECEPTORS, GLUCOCORTICOID; RNA, MESSENGER","BBRED","NAHAVANDI, A.; NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH CENTER, DEPT.

EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT PARENTAL EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO CONCEPTION CAN AFFECT INHERITANCE OF COMPLEX BEHAVIORS IN OFFSPRING VIA NON-GENOMIC (EPIGENETIC) MECHANISMS. FOR INSTANCE, MALE C57BL/6J (B6) MICE EXPOSED TO CHRONIC INTERMITTENT VAPOR ETHANOL (CIE) PRIOR TO MATING WITH STRAIN 129S1/SVIMJ ETHANOL-NAVE FEMALES PRODUCE MALE OFFSPRING WITH REDUCED ETHANOL-DRINKING PREFERENCE, INCREASED ETHANOL SENSITIVITY, AND INCREASED BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) EXPRESSION IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA (VTA). IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE TESTED THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THESE INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF PATERNAL CIE ARE REPRODUCIBLE IN MALE OFFSPRING ON AN INBRED B6 BACKGROUND. TO THIS END, B6 MALES WERE EXPOSED TO 6 WEEKS OF CIE (OR ROOM AIR AS A CONTROL) BEFORE MATING WITH ETHANOL-NAVE B6 FEMALES TO PRODUCE ETHANOL (E)-SIRED AND CONTROL (C)-SIRED MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING. WE OBSERVED A SEX-SPECIFIC EFFECT, AS E-SIRED MALES EXHIBITED DECREASED TWO-BOTTLE FREE-CHOICE ETHANOL-DRINKING PREFERENCE, INCREASED SENSITIVITY TO THE ANXIOLYTIC EFFECTS OF ETHANOL, AND INCREASED VTA BDNF EXPRESSION; NO DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN FEMALE OFFSPRING.

IT IS NOW RECOGNIZED THAT PATERNAL EFFECTS CAN BE TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE EJACULATE, BUT UNAMBIGUOUS EVIDENCE FOR THEM IS SCARCE, BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO ISOLATE EFFECTS OPERATING VIA CHANGES TO THE EJACULATE FROM MATERNAL EFFECTS DRIVEN BY FEMALE MATE ASSESSMENT. HERE,WE USE ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION TO DISENTANGLE MATE ASSESSMENT FROM FERTILIZATION IN GUPPIES, AND SHOWTHAT PATERNAL EFFECTS CAN BE TRANSMITTED TO OFFSPRING EXCLUSIVELY VIA EJACULATES.WE SHOWTHATMALES FED REDUCED DIETS PRODUCE POOR-QUALITY SPERMAND THAT OFFSPRING SIRED BY SUCH MALES (VIA ARTIFICIAL INSEMINATION) EXHIBIT REDUCED BODY SIZE AT BIRTH.

WE PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED SPECIFIC PERTURBATIONS OF FERTILIZATION, BLASTOCYST FORMATION, IMPLANTATION, AS WELL AS ABERRANT GLUCOSE METABOLISM AND ADIPOSITY IN OFFSPRING USING A MOUSE MODEL OF PATERNAL OBESITY. THE CURRENT INVESTIGATION ANALYZED GENE EXPRESSION AND METHYLATION OF SPECIFIC CPG RESIDUES IN F1 PLACENTAS OF PREGNANCIES FATHERED BY OBESE AND NORMAL-WEIGHT MALE MICE, USING REAL-TIME PCR AND BISULFITE PYROSEQUENCING. OUR AIM WAS TO DETERMINE IF PATERNAL OBESITY DEREGULATED PLACENTAL GENE EXPRESSION AND DNA METHYLATION WHEN COMPARED TO NORMAL-WEIGHT MALES. GENE METHYLATION OF SPERM DNA WAS ANALYZED AND COMPARED TO PLACENTAS TO ADDRESS EPIGENETIC TRANSMISSION. OF THE 10 PATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENES (PEGS), 11 GENES IMPORTANT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSPORT OF NUTRIENTS, AND THE LONG-TERMINAL REPEAT INTRACISTERNAL A PARTICLE (IAP) ELEMENTS, DERIVED FROM A MEMBER OF THE CLASS II ENDOGENOUS RETROVIRAL GENE FAMILY, WE OBSERVED A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF PATERNAL DIET-INDUCED OBESITY ON DEREGULATED EXPRESSION OF PEG3, PEG9, PEG10, AND THE NUTRIENT TRANSPORTER GENE SLC38A2, AND ABERRANT DNA METHYLATION OF THE PEG9 PROMOTER IN F1 PLACENTAL TISSUE. EPIGENETIC CHANGES IN PEG9 WERE ALSO FOUND IN SPERM FROM OBESE FATHERS.

WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT DLAN HAS TRANSGENERATIONAL INFLUENCES ON IMMUNE FUNCTION. ADULT MALE AND FEMALE SIBERIAN HAMSTERS WERE EXPOSED TO EITHER DARK NIGHTS (DARK) OR DLAN (5 LUX) FOR 9 WEEKS, THEN PAIRED IN FULL FACTORIAL DESIGN, MATED, AND THEREAFTER HOUSED UNDER DARK NIGHTS. OFFSPRING WERE GESTATED AND REARED IN DARK NIGHTS, THEN TESTED AS ADULTS FOR CELL-MEDIATED AND HUMORAL IMMUNITY. MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO DLAN DAMPENED DELAYED TYPE HYPERSENSITIVITY (DTH) RESPONSES IN MALE OFFSPRING. MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO DLAN REDUCED DTH RESPONSES IN FEMALE OFFSPRING. IGG ANTIBODIES TO A NOVEL ANTIGEN WERE ELEVATED IN OFFSPRING OF DAMS EXPOSED TO DLAN. PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO DLAN DECREASED SPLENIC ENDOCRINE RECEPTOR EXPRESSION AND GLOBAL METHYLATION IN A PARENTAL SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER.

HERE, WE ESTABLISH A PATERNAL EFFECT MODEL BASED ON NICOTINE EXPOSURE IN MICE, ENABLING PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERROGATION OF THE SPECIFICITY OF THE OFFSPRING RESPONSE. PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO NICOTINE PRIOR TO REPRODUCTION INDUCED A BROAD PROTECTIVE RESPONSE TO MULTIPLE XENOBIOTICS IN MALE OFFSPRING. THIS EFFECT MANIFESTED AS INCREASED SURVIVAL FOLLOWING INJECTION OF TOXIC LEVELS OF EITHER NICOTINE OR COCAINE, ACCOMPANIED BY HEPATIC UPREGULATION OF XENOBIOTIC PROCESSING GENES, AND ENHANCED DRUG CLEARANCE. SURPRISINGLY, THIS PROTECTIVE EFFECT COULD ALSO BE INDUCED BY A NICOTINIC RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST, SUGGESTING THAT XENOBIOTIC EXPOSURE, RATHER THAN NICOTINIC RECEPTOR SIGNALING, IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROGRAMMING OFFSPRING DRUG RESISTANCE.

BIOL.","BACKGROUND: PHENOTYPIC CHANGES IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES CAN PERSIST FROM ONE GENERATION INTO THE NEXT. IN MANY SYSTEMS PARENTAL PARASITE EXPERIENCE INFLUENCES OFFSPRING IMMUNE RESPONSES, KNOWN AS TRANSGENERATIONAL IMMUNE PRIMING (TGIP). TGIP IN VERTEBRATES IS MAINLY MATERNAL AND SHORT-TERM, SUPPORTING THE ADAPTIVE IMMUNE SYSTEM OF THE OFFSPRING DURING ITS MATURATION. HOWEVER, IF FATHERS AND OFFSPRING HAVE A CLOSE PHYSICAL CONNECTION, EVOLUTION OF ADDITIONAL PATERNAL IMMUNE PRIMING CAN BE ADAPTIVE. BIPARENTAL TGIP MAY RESULT IN MAXIMIZED IMMUNOLOGICAL PROTECTION. HERE, WE INVESTIGATE MULTIGENERATIONAL BIPARENTAL TGIP IN THE SEX-ROLE REVERSED PIPEFISH SYNGNATHUS TYPHLE BY EXPOSING GRANDPARENTS TO AN IMMUNE CHALLENGE WITH HEAT-KILLED BACTERIA AND ASSESSING GENE EXPRESSION (44 TARGET GENES) OF THE F2-GENERATION. RESULTS: GRANDPARENTAL IMMUNE CHALLENGE INDUCED GENE EXPRESSION OF IMMUNE GENES IN ONE-WEEK-OLD GRANDOFFSPRING. SIMILARLY, GENES MEDIATING EPIGENETIC REGULATION INCLUDING DNA-METHYLATION AND HISTONE MODIFICATIONS WERE INVOLVED IN GRANDPARENTAL IMMUNE PRIMING. WHILE GRAND-MATERNAL IMPACT WAS STRONG ON GENES OF THE COMPLEMENT COMPONENT SYSTEM, GRAND-PATERNAL EXPOSURE CHANGED EXPRESSION PATTERNS OF GENES MEDIATING INNATE IMMUNE DEFENSE. CONCLUSION: IN A SYSTEM WITH MALE PREGNANCY, GRANDPARENTS INFLUENCED THE IMMUNE SYSTEM OF THEIR GRANDOFFSPRING IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER, DEMONSTRATING MULTIGENERATIONAL BIPARENTAL TGIP. THE INVOLVEMENT OF EPIGENETIC EFFECTS SUGGESTS THAT TGIP VIA THE PATERNAL LINE MAY NOT BE LIMITED TO THE PIPEFISH SYSTEM THAT DISPLAYS MALE PREGNANCY. WHILE THE BENEFITS AND COSTS OF GRANDPARENTAL TGIP DEPEND ON THE TEMPORAL HETEROGENEITY OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS, MULTIGENERATIONAL TGIP MAY AFFECT HOST-PARASITE COEVOLUTION BY DAMPENING THE AMPLITUDE OF RED QUEEN DYNAMICS. 2017 THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,"FISH PROTEINS",NA,"ROTH, O.; EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF MARINE FISHES, HELMHOLTZ-CENTRE FOR OCEAN RESEARCH KIEL (GEOMAR), DSTERNBROOKER WEG 20, GERMANY; EMAIL: OROTH@GEOMAR.DE","ARTICLE","10.1186/s12862-017-0885-3",NA,"14712148","BMC EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,7,"1",NA,"1-15","BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.","28173760","SCOPUS","GRANDPARENTAL IMMUNE PRIMING IN THE PIPEFISH SYNGNATHUS TYPHLE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85011684774&doi=10.1186%2fs12862-017-0885-3&partnerID=40&md5=42ebf61dab43e7c1917d41a778d6bbb8","17",2017,"NA NA NA","HELMHOLTZ-CENTRE FOR OCEAN RESEARCH KIEL (GEOMAR)","NOTREPORTED;HELMHOLTZ-CENTRE FOR OCEAN RESEARCH KIEL (GEOMAR);NOTREPORTED",NA,"BEEMELMANNS A, 2017, BMC EVOL BIOL","BEEMELMANNS A, 2017, BMC EVOL BIOL"

TOXICOL.","THE SYNTHETIC ESTROGEN 17--ETHINYLESTRADIOL (EE2), A MAJOR CONSTITUENT IN CONTRACEPTIVE PILLS, IS AN ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICAL (EDC) PRESENT IN THE AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT AT CONCENTRATIONS OF NG/L. DEVELOPMENTAL EXPOSURE TO THESE LOW CONCENTRATIONS IN FISH CAN INDUCE SEVERAL DISORDERS. ZEBRAFISH (DANIO RERIO) IS A PERFECT ORGANISM FOR MONITORING THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINANTS. OUR HYPOTHESIS IS THAT CHANGES PROMOTED BY EE2 IN THE GERM LINE OF MALE ADULTS COULD BE TRANSMITTED TO THE UNEXPOSED PROGENY. WE EXPOSED MALE ZEBRAFISH TO 2.5, 5 AND 10 NG/L OF EE2 DURING SPERMATOGENESIS AND MATED THEM WITH UNTREATED FEMALES. DETAILED PROGENY DEVELOPMENT WAS STUDIED CONCENTRATING TO SURVIVAL, HATCHING AND MALFORMATIONS. DUE TO THE HIGH INCIDENCE OF LYMPHEDEMAS WITHIN LARVAE, WE PERFORMED QPCR ANALYSIS OF GENES INVOLVED IN LYMPHATIC DEVELOPMENT (VEGFC AND VEGFR3) AND ENDOTHELIAL CELL MIGRATION GUIDANCE (CXCR4A AND CXCL12B). ESTROGEN RECEPTOR (ER) TRANSCRIPT PRESENCE WAS ALSO EVALUATED IN SPERM, TESTIS AND EMBRYOS. PROGENIES SHOWED A RANGE OF DISORDERS ALTHOUGH AT A LOW INCIDENCE: SKELETAL DISTORTIONS, UNINFLATED SWIMBLADDER, LYMPHEDEMA FORMATION, CARTILAGE DEFORMITIES AND OTOLITH TETHERING. SWIMMING EVALUATION REVEALED LESS ACTIVE LOCOMOTION. ALL THESE PROCESSES ARE RELATED TO PATHWAYS INVOLVING ERS (ESR1, ESR2A AND ESR2B). MRNA ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL EE2 CAUSES THE UP-REGULATION OF ESR1 AN ESR2B IN TESTIS AND THE INCREASE OF ESR2B TRANSCRIPTS IN SPERM POINTING TO A LINK BETWEEN LYMPHEDEMA IN EMBRYOS AND ER EXPRESSION IMPAIRMENT. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE EFFECTS INDUCED BY ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS CAN BE PATERNALLY INHERITED AND POINT TO THE CHANGES ON THE SPERM TRANSCRIPTOME AS THE RESPONSIBLE MECHANISM. 2017 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"CHEMOKINE RECEPTOR CXCR4, 188900-71-2; ETHINYLESTRADIOL, 57-63-6; RNA, 63231-63-0; VASCULOTROPIN C, 171342-42-0, 185969-81-7; ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS; ETHINYL ESTRADIOL; RECEPTORS, ESTROGEN; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL; ZEBRAFISH PROTEINS","AQTOD","HERREZ, M.P.; DEPARTMENT OF MOLECULAR BIOLOGY, UNIVERSIDAD DE LENSPAIN; EMAIL: PAZ.HERRAEZ@UNILEON.ES","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.aquatox.2017.09.025","AGL2014-53167-C3-3-R","0166445X","AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,7,NA,NA,"18-29","ELSEVIER B.V.","29028550","SCOPUS","PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO ENVIRONMENTAL 17-ALPHA-ETHINYLESTRADIOL CONCENTRATIONS MODIFIES TESTICULAR TRANSCRIPTION, AFFECTING THE SPERM TRANSCRIPT CONTENT AND THE OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE IN ZEBRAFISH",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85030843975&doi=10.1016%2fj.aquatox.2017.09.025&partnerID=40&md5=b6305241d0a24d0cc0d44a5796b9bcfb","193",2017,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE SPANISH MINISTRY OF ECONOMY AND COMPETITIVENESS (PROJECT AGL2014-53167-C3-3-R).

RES.","BACKGROUND PRENATAL PHTHALATE EXPOSURE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH BEHAVIORAL PROBLEMS AND LOWER PERFORMANCE ON MEASURES OF COGNITIVE ABILITY IN CHILDREN. HOWEVER, THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF PHTHALATE EXPOSURE DURING THE SENSITIVE PRECONCEPTION PERIOD IS UNKNOWN. OBJECTIVES TO ESTIMATE THE ASSOCIATION OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION URINARY PHTHALATE METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS WITH CHILD BEHAVIOR AND EVALUATE POTENTIAL MODIFICATION BY CHILD SEX. METHODS WE USED DATA FROM 166 CHILDREN (111 SINGLETONS, 26 PAIRS OF TWINS, AND 1 SET OF TRIPLETS) BORN TO 134 MOTHERS AND 100 FATHERS PARTICIPATING IN A PROSPECTIVE PRECONCEPTION COHORT STUDY OF SUBFERTILE COUPLES FROM THE MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL FERTILITY CENTER. WE ESTIMATED MEAN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION EXPOSURES BY AVERAGING INDIVIDUAL PHTHALATE METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS IN MULTIPLE URINE SAMPLES COLLECTED BEFORE PREGNANCY. WE ASSESSED CHILDREN'S BEHAVIOR AT 29 YEARS OF AGE BY PARENT REPORT USING THE BEHAVIOR ASSESSMENT SYSTEM FOR CHILDREN-2 (BASC-2). WE ESTIMATED THE COVARIATE-ADJUSTED ASSOCIATION BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL PHTHALATE METABOLITE CONCENTRATIONS AND THE SUM OF DI(2-ETHYLHEXYL) PHTHALATE METABOLITES ( DEHP) AND BEHAVIOR SCORES, AND EVALUATED DIFFERENCES IN ASSOCIATIONS BY CHILD SEX USING LINEAR REGRESSION WITH GENERALIZED ESTIMATING EQUATIONS. MODELS WERE FURTHER ADJUSTED FOR PRENATAL PHTHALATE CONCENTRATIONS IN SENSITIVITY ANALYSES. RESULTS EACH LOGE-UNIT INCREASE IN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION CONCENTRATIONS OF DEHP WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 2.0 (95% CI: 3.2, 0.7) AND 1.8 (95% CI: 3.1, 0.4) POINT DECREASE IN BASC-2 INTERNALIZING BEHAVIOR SCORES AMONG ALL CHILDREN, RESPECTIVELY. WE OBSERVED SEX-SPECIFIC ASSOCIATIONS FOR SOME PHTHALATE BIOMARKERS: AMONG BOYS, MATERNAL MONOISOBUTYL PHTHALATE (MIBP) WAS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH EXTERNALIZING BEHAVIORS, AND PATERNAL MIBP AND MONO-N-BUTYL PHTHALATE WERE POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNALIZING BEHAVIORS. CONCLUSIONS IN THIS COHORT, PATERNAL AND MATERNAL PRECONCEPTION CONCENTRATIONS OF SOME PHTHALATE BIOMARKERS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC ASPECTS OF CHILD BEHAVIOR, EVEN AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR PRENATAL CONCENTRATIONS. WHILE ADDITIONAL RESEARCH IS WARRANTED TO CONFIRM THESE RESULTS, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE PRECONCEPTION PERIOD OF EXPOSURE MAY BE A CRITICAL WINDOW FOR OFFSPRING NEURODEVELOPMENT. 2017",NA,"PHTHALIC ACID, 88-99-3; PHTHALIC ACID BIS(2 ETHYLHEXYL) ESTER, 117-81-7; ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS; PHTHALIC ACIDS","ENVRA","MESSERLIAN, C.; HARVARD T.H.

PSYCHIATRY","THERE IS GROWING EVIDENCE THAT THE PRECONCEPTUAL LIFESTYLE AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES OF A FATHER CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPES OF THEIR CHILDREN. WE AND OTHERS HAVE SHOWN THAT PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION STRESS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE STRESS WAS EXPERIENCED DURING EARLY-LIFE OR ADULTHOOD, RESULTS IN OFFSPRING WITH ALTERED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION-RELATED BEHAVIORS, ATTRIBUTED TO HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS DYSREGULATION. THE TRANSGENERATIONAL RESPONSE TO PATERNAL PRECONCEPTUAL STRESS IS BELIEVED TO BE MEDIATED BY SPERM-BORNE SMALL NONCODING RNAS, SPECIFICALLY MICRORNAS. AS PHYSICAL ACTIVITY CONFERS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH BENEFITS FOR THE INDIVIDUAL, WE USED A MODEL OF VOLUNTARY WHEEL-RUNNING AND INVESTIGATED THE TRANSGENERATIONAL RESPONSE TO PATERNAL EXERCISE. WE FOUND THAT MALE OFFSPRING OF RUNNERS HAD SUPPRESSED REINSTATEMENT OF JUVENILE FEAR MEMORY, AND REDUCED ANXIETY IN THE LIGHT-DARK APPARATUS DURING ADULTHOOD. NO CHANGES IN THESE AFFECTIVE BEHAVIORS WERE OBSERVED IN FEMALE OFFSPRING. WE WERE SURPRISED TO FIND THAT RUNNING HAD A LIMITED IMPACT ON SPERM-BORNE MICRORNAS. THE LEVELS OF THREE UNIQUE MICRORNAS (MIR-19B, MIR-455 AND MIR-133A) WERE FOUND TO BE ALTERED IN THE SPERM OF RUNNERS. IN ADDITION, WE DISCOVERED THAT THE LEVELS OF TWO SPECIES OF TRNA-DERIVED RNAS (TDRS) - TRNA-GLY AND TRNA-PRO - WERE ALSO ALTERED BY RUNNING. TAKEN TOGETHER, WE BELIEVE THIS IS THE FIRST EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL EXERCISE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN ANXIOLYTIC BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE OF MALE OFFSPRING AND ALTERED LEVELS OF SMALL NONCODING RNAS IN SPERM. THESE SMALL NONCODING RNAS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON POST-TRANSCRIPTIONAL GENE REGULATION AND CAN THUS CHANGE THE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORY OF OFFSPRING BRAINS AND ASSOCIATED AFFECTIVE BEHAVIORS.

GIVEN THAT BISPHENOL A (BPA), A UBIQUITOUS COMPOUND IN MATERNAL DIET, MAY DISRUPT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIOR, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT PATERNAL BPA DIET (PBD) COULD AFFECT OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT. PREFRONTAL CORTEX (PFC), A VITAL BRAIN REGION, IS INVOLVED IN EMOTION AND SOCIAL BEHAVIOR. TO TEST WHETHER PBD COULD ALTER DEVELOPING PFC, WE CARRIED OUT A PROTEOMICS APPROACH FOR PFC IN MALE JUVENILE OFFSPRING THAT RESPONDED TO PBD (50 MG BPA/KG DIET). WE FOUND THAT PBD ALTERED THE EXPRESSIONS OF BINDING IMMUNOGLOBULIN PROTEIN (BIP), CCAAT/-ENHANCER-BINDING PROTEIN HOMOLOGOUS PROTEIN (CHOP) AND B-CELL LYMPHOMA-2 (BCL-2), WHICH COULD REFLECT ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM (ER) STRESS. IN ADDITION, DOWNREGULATION OF MYELINOGENESIS GENES AND MYELIN BASIC PROTEIN (MBP) COULD PROVOKE MYELIN DEFICIENCY. FURTHERMORE, PBD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR AND IMPAIRED SOCIAL BEHAVIOR IN MALE OFFSPRING. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS REVEALED THE ALTERATIONS OF ER STRESS AND MYELIN DESTRUCTION RELATED MOLECULES INDUCED BY PBD MIGHT BE A POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR THE BEHAVIOR DEFICITS IN THEIR MALE OFFSPRING.

OUR PREVIOUS WORK USING A RODENT MODEL OF DIETINDUCED PATERNAL OBESITY SHOWED THAT FEMALE OFFSPRING FROM HIGH-FAT DIET (HFD)-FED FATHERS DEVELOP GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE DUE TO IMPAIRMENT OF PANCREATIC INSULIN SECRETION. HERE, WE FOCUSED ON THE HEALTH OUTCOMES OF MALE OFFSPRING FROM HFD-FED FATHERS. MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS (3 WK OLD) WERE FED CONTROL (CD-F0) OR HFD (HFD-F0) FOR 12 WK BEFORE MATING WITH CONTROL-FED FEMALES. MALE OFFSPRING WERE FED CONTROL DIETS FOR UP TO 8 WK OR 6 MO. ALTHOUGH MALE OFFSPRING FROM HFD-F0 DID NOT DEVELOP ANY OBVIOUS GLUCOSE METABOLISM DEFECTS IN THIS STUDY, SURPRISINGLY, A GROWTH DEFICIT PHENOTYPE WAS OBSERVED FROM BIRTH TO 6 MO OF AGE. MALE OFFSPRING FROM HFD-F0 HAD REDUCED BIRTH WEIGHT COMPARED WITH CD-F0, FOLLOWED BY REDUCED POSTWEANING GROWTH FROM 9 WK OF AGE. THIS RESULTED IN 10% REDUCTION IN BODY WEIGHT AT 6 MO WITH SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER FAT PADS AND SKELETAL MUSCLES. REDUCED CIRCULATING LEVELS OF GROWTH HORMONE (GH) AND IGF-I WERE DETECTED AT 8 WK AND 6 MO, RESPECTIVELY. EXPRESSION OF ADIPOGENESIS MARKERS WAS DECREASED IN ADIPOSE TISSUE OF HFD-F0 OFFSPRING AT 8 WK AND 6 MO, AND EXPRESSION OF GROWTH MARKERS WAS DECREASED IN MUSCLE OF HFD-F0 OFFSPRING AT 8 WK. WE PROPOSE THAT THE REDUCED GH SECRETION AT 8 WK OF AGE ALTERED THE GROWTH OF MALE OFFSPRING FROM HFD-F0, RESULTING IN SMALLER ANIMALS FROM 9 WK TO 6 MO OF AGE. FURTHERMORE, INCREASED MUSCLE TRIGLYCERIDE CONTENT AND EXPRESSION OF LIPOGENIC GENES WERE OBSERVED IN HFD-F0 OFFSPRING, POTENTIALLY INCREASING THEIR METABOLIC RISK. 2017 THE AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY.",NA,NA,"AJPMD","MORRIS, M.J.; SCHOOL OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, DEPT.

J. CLIN. NUTR.","BACKGROUND: THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED RECOGNITION THAT PRENATAL OR PERINATAL NUTRITION HAS AN EFFECT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES (T2D) IN ADULTHOOD, ALTHOUGH STUDIES THAT HAVE DIRECTLY EXAMINED WHETHER THE EFFECT COULD BE TRANSMITTED TO THE NEXT GENERATION REMAIN SPARSE. OBJECTIVE: WE INVESTIGATED THE ROLE OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO THE CHINESE FAMINE IN AFFECTING FUTURE T2D RISK IN ADULTHOOD IN 2 CONSECUTIVE GENERATIONS. DESIGN: A TOTAL OF 1034 FAMILIES, INCLUDING 2068 PARENTS [PARENTAL GENERATION (F1)] AND 1183 OFFSPRING [OFFSPRING GENERATION (F2)], WERE RECRUITED FROM THE SUIHUA RURAL AREA THAT WAS AFFECTED BY THE CHINESE FAMINE OF 1959-1961. PARTICIPANTS BORN BETWEEN 1 OCTOBER 1959 AND 30 SEPTEMBER 1961 WERE DEFINED AS FAMINE EXPOSED, AND THOSE BORN BETWEEN 1 OCTOBER 1962 AND 30 SEPTEMBER 1964 WERE DEFINED AS NONEXPOSED. THE F2 WERE CLASSIFIED AS HAVING 1) NO PARENT EXPOSED TO FAMINE, 2) ONLY A MOTHER EXPOSED TO FAMINE, 3) ONLY A FATHER EXPOSED TO FAMINE, OR 4) BOTH PARENTS EXPOSED TO FAMINE. CLASSICAL RISK FACTORS FOR T2D AS WELL AS FASTING-GLUCOSE- AND ORAL-GLUCOSETOLERANCE TESTS WERE MEASURED IN BOTH THE F1 AND F2. RESULTS: PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO FAMINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED RISKS OF HYPERGLYCEMIA (MULTIVARIABLE-ADJUSTED OR: 1.93; 95% CI: 1.51, 2.48) AND T2D (OR: 1.75; 95% CI: 1.20, 2.54) IN ADULTHOOD IN F1. FURTHERMORE, COMPARED WITH THE OFFSPRING OF NONEXPOSED PARENTS, THE F2 WITH EXPOSED PARENTS-ESPECIALLY BOTH EXPOSED PARENTS-HAD INCREASED HYPERGLYCEMIA RISK (OR: 2.02; 95% CI: 1.12, 3.66) IN ADULTHOOD. CONCLUSION: PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO FAMINE REMARKABLY INCREASES HYPERGLYCEMIA RISK IN 2 CONSECUTIVE GENERATIONS OF CHINESE ADULTS INDEPENDENT OF KNOWN T2D RISK FACTORS, WHICH SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT PRENATAL NUTRITION PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF T2D ACROSS CONSECUTIVE GENERATIONS OF CHINESE ADULTS.

SMALL MAGNITUDE ASSOCIATIONS REPORTED IN OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES ARE LIKELY TO BE MISLEADING DUE TO CONFOUNDING AND MISCLASSIFICATION BIASES. ALTERNATIVE ANALYTICAL APPROACHES SUCH AS THE USE OF FAMILY NEGATIVE CONTROLS (E.G. COMPARING THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EXPOSURE) COULD HELP DISENTANGLE CAUSAL EFFECTS. WE INVESTIGATED THE ASSOCIATION OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL ALCOHOL DRINKING BEFORE AND EARLY IN PREGNANCY WITH INFANT HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE, USING DATA FROM 68,244 MOTHER-FATHER-OFFSPRING TRIOS FROM THE NORWEGIAN MOTHER AND CHILD COHORT STUDY (MOBA) (1999-2009). IN ANALYSES ADJUSTED FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS, WE FOUND NO CONSISTENT PATTERN OF ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MATERNAL OR PATERNAL ALCOHOL INTAKE BEFORE OR DURING PREGNANCY AND OFFSPRING HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE MODELLED AS A CONTINUOUS OUTCOME. HOWEVER, WE FOUND HIGHER ODDS OF MICROCEPHALY AT BIRTH FOR HIGHER PATERNAL, BUT NOT MATERNAL, ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION BEFORE PREGNANCY, AND SIMILAR BUT WEAKER EFFECT ESTIMATES FOR FIRST TRIMESTER DRINKING. ASSOCIATIONS WITH PATERNAL DRINKING BEFORE PREGNANCY WERE UNEXPECTED AND SHOULD BE REGARDED AS HYPOTHESIS GENERATING, UNTIL INDEPENDENTLY REPLICATED, ALTHOUGH POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT GIVEN THE ABSENCE OF GUIDELINES ON SAFE DRINKING LEVELS FOR MEN IN COUPLES TRYING FOR A PREGNANCY.

RES.","BACKGROUND HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE SEQUEL OF PARENTAL GENOCIDE EXPOSURES ON THE OFFSPRING'S RISK AND COURSE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA REMAIN UNTESTED. AIMS TO TEST HYPOTHESES RELATED TO THE TRANSGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF PARENTAL GENOCIDE EXPOSURE ON THE RISK AND COURSE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA. METHODS DATA WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE NATIONAL POPULATION REGISTER ON ALL OFFSPRING (N = 51.233; BORN: 19481989) WHOSE PARENTS WERE BORN (1922 TO 1945) IN NAZI- DOMINATED EUROPEAN NATIONS. BOTH PARENTS EITHER IMMIGRATED BEFORE (INDIRECT EXPOSURE: N = 1627, 3.2%) OR AFTER (DIRECT EXPOSURE: N = 49.606, 96.8%) THE NAZI ERA. OFFSPRING SUBGROUPS WERE IDENTIFIED FROM THE INITIAL TIMING OF PARENTAL EXPOSURE (E.G., LIKELY IN UTERO, COMBINED IN UTERO AND POSTNATAL, OR POSTNATAL). SCHIZOPHRENIA DISORDERS WERE ASCERTAINED (19502014) FROM THE NATIONAL PSYCHIATRIC CASE REGISTRY. COX MODELS WERE COMPUTED TO COMPARE THE OFFSPRING GROUPS WITH RESPECT TO THE RISK AND THE ADVERSE COURSE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA, ADJUSTING FOR CONFOUNDERS. RESULTS THE OFFSPRING RATES ON THE RISK AND COURSE OF SCHIZOPHRENIA DID NOT DIFFER BY PARENTAL AFFILIATION TO THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT EXPOSURE GROUPS. COX MODELS SHOWED THAT OFFSPRING SUBGROUPS WITH MATERNAL HOLOCAUST EXPOSURES IN UTERO ONLY (HR = 1.74, 1.13, 2.66) AND COMBINED IN UTERO AND POSTNATAL (HR = 1.48, 1.05, 2.10); AS WELL AS PATERNAL HOLOCAUST EXPOSURES COMBINED IN UTERO AND POSTNATAL (HR = 1.48, 1.08, 2.05), AND EARLY POSTNATAL (AGED 12; HR = 1.49, 1.10, 2.00) HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY (P < 0.05) HIGHER PSYCHIATRIC RE-HOSPITALIZATION RATE THAN THE INDIRECT GROUP.

SOME OF THESE SYMPTOMS CAN BE TRANSMITTED TO THE OFFSPRING, IN SOME CASES BY NON-GENOMIC MECHANISMS INVOLVING GERM CELLS. USING A MOUSE MODEL OF UNPREDICTABLE MATERNAL SEPARATION AND MATERNAL STRESS, WE SHOW THAT POSTNATAL TRAUMA ALTERS COPING BEHAVIORS IN ADVERSE CONDITIONS IN EXPOSED MALES WHEN ADULT AND IN THEIR ADULT MALE PROGENY. THE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASED GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR (GR) EXPRESSION AND DECREASED DNA METHYLATION OF THE GR PROMOTER IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS. DNA METHYLATION IS ALSO DECREASED IN SPERM CELLS OF EXPOSED MALES WHEN ADULT. TRANSGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF BEHAVIORAL SYMPTOMS IS PREVENTED BY PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT, AN EFFECT ASSOCIATED WITH THE REVERSAL OF ALTERATIONS IN GR GENE EXPRESSION AND DNA METHYLATION IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF THE MALE OFFSPRING.

ECOL.","ALTHOUGH THE ECOLOGICAL AND EVOLUTIONARY IMPORTANCE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED PARENTAL EFFECTS IS NOW WIDELY RECOGNIZED, SUCH EFFECTS ARE STILL TYPICALLY STUDIED BY CONTRASTING JUST TWO ENVIRONMENTS IN A SINGLE PARENTAL SEX. YET, PARENTAL EFFECTS SHOULD GENERALLY BE VIEWED AS REACTION NORMS, AND A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR ECOLOGICAL ROLE THEREFORE REQUIRES EXAMINING CONTINUOUSLY VARYING AND INTERACTING ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES IN BOTH PARENTAL SEXES. WE USED NUTRITIONAL GEOMETRY TO INVESTIGATE LINEAR, NONLINEAR AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS OF PROTEIN AND CARBOHYDRATE IN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL LARVAL DIETS ON OFFSPRING JUVENILE DEVELOPMENT AND VIABILITY AND ADULT BODY SIZE AND SHAPE IN THE FLY TELOSTYLINUS ANGUSTICOLLIS (DIPTERA: NERIIDAE). WE FOUND THAT EGG HATCHING SUCCESS WAS ENHANCED BY PROTEIN IN THE MATERNAL LARVAL DIET BUT REDUCED BY PROTEIN IN THE PATERNAL LARVAL DIET, WHILE OTHER JUVENILE TRAITS WERE UNAFFECTED BY PARENTAL DIETS. MATERNAL EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING ADULT BODY SIZE AND HEAD ELONGATION (A SECONDARY SEXUAL TRAIT IN MALES) WERE MEDIATED BY LINEAR AND QUADRATIC EFFECTS OF PROTEIN, AND WERE CONSISTENT IN SONS AND DAUGHTERS. IN CONTRAST, PATERNAL EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING BODY SIZE AND HEAD ELONGATION WERE MEDIATED BY CARBOHYDRATE EFFECTS OR CARBOHYDRATEPROTEIN INTERACTIONS, AND VARIED BY OFFSPRING SEX. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT MACRONUTRIENTS IN THE PARENTAL LARVAL DIET CAN HAVE COMPLEX, NONLINEAR AND INTERACTIVE EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING TRAITS, AND THAT THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL DIETS CAN BE STRIKINGLY DIFFERENT. EFFECTS OF PARENTAL DIET ON OFFSPRING REPRESENT IMPORTANT FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF VARIATION IN NUTRIENT INTAKE, WITH POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR THE EVOLUTION OF FORAGING AND REPRODUCTIVE STRATEGIES. 2016 THE AUTHORS.

SCI.","EARLY-LIFE ADVERSITY IS A POTENT RISK FACTOR FOR MENTAL-HEALTH DISORDERS IN EXPOSED INDIVIDUALS, AND EFFECTS OF ADVERSITY ARE EXHIBITED ACROSS GENERATIONS. SUCH ADVERSITIES ARE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH POOR GASTROINTESTINAL OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION, EMERGING EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT MICROBIOTA-GUT-BRAIN INTERACTIONS MAY MEDIATE THE EFFECTS OF EARLY-LIFE STRESS ON PSYCHOLOGICAL DYSFUNCTION. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE ADMINISTERED AN EARLY-LIFE STRESSOR (I.E., MATERNAL SEPARATION) TO INFANT MALE RATS, AND WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF THIS STRESSOR ON CONDITIONED AVERSIVE REACTIONS IN THE RATS SUBSEQUENT INFANT MALE OFFSPRING. WE DEMONSTRATED, FOR THE FIRST TIME, LONGER-LASTING AVERSIVE ASSOCIATIONS AND GREATER RELAPSE AFTER EXTINCTION IN THE OFFSPRING (F1 GENERATION) OF RATS EXPOSED TO MATERNAL SEPARATION (F0 GENERATION), COMPARED WITH THE OFFSPRING OF RATS NOT EXPOSED TO MATERNAL SEPARATION. THESE GENERATIONAL EFFECTS WERE REVERSED BY PROBIOTIC SUPPLEMENTATION, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE AS BOTH AN ACTIVE TREATMENT WHEN ADMINISTERED TO INFANT F1 RATS AND AS A PROPHYLACTIC WHEN ADMINISTERED TO F0 FATHERS BEFORE CONCEPTION (I.E., IN FATHERS INFANCY). THESE FINDINGS HAVE HIGH CLINICAL RELEVANCE IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF EARLY-EMERGING PUTATIVE RISK PHENOTYPES ACROSS GENERATIONS AND OF POTENTIAL THERAPIES TO AMELIORATE SUCH GENERATIONAL EFFECTS. 2016, THE AUTHOR(S) 2016.",NA,NA,"PSYSE","CALLAGHAN, B.L.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, 1190 AMSTERDAM AVE., UNITED STATES; EMAIL: BLC2139@COLUMBIA.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1177/0956797616653103",NA,"09567976","PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,21,"9",NA,"1171-1180","SAGE PUBLICATIONS INC.","27422874","SCOPUS","TREATING GENERATIONAL STRESS: EFFECT OF PATERNAL STRESS ON DEVELOPMENT OF MEMORY AND EXTINCTION IN OFFSPRING IS REVERSED BY PROBIOTIC TREATMENT",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84986275957&doi=10.1177%2f0956797616653103&partnerID=40&md5=f7ade1accdbe7a31f2df006396130bd0","27",2016,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES;COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE","NOTREPORTED;COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"CALLAGHAN BL, 2016, PSYCHOL SCI","CALLAGHAN BL, 2016, PSYCHOL SCI"

BRAIN FUNCT.","BACKGROUND: HEROIN ADDICTION IS A GROWING CONCERN, AFFECTING THE SOCIOECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OF MANY COUNTRIES. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS ON PHENOTYPE CHANGES DUE TO HEROIN ADDICTION. THIS STUDY AIMS TO INVESTIGATE CHANGES IN LEVEL OF ANXIETY AND AGGRESSION UP TO FOUR DIFFERENT GENERATIONS OF ADULT MALE RATS DUE TO PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO HEROIN. METHODS: MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE EXPOSED WITH HEROIN INTRAPERITONEALLY (I.P.) TWICE-DAILY FOR 14 DAYS WITH INCREASING DOSAGE REGIMEN (F0-HEROIN). MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS (6-WEEKS-OLD) WERE DIVIDED INTO: (1) HEROIN EXPOSED GROUP (F0-HEROIN) AND (2) CONTROL GROUP TREATED WITH SALINE SOLUTION (F0-CONTROL). THE DOSAGE REGIME STARTED WITH THE LOWEST DOSE OF 3 MG/KG PER DAY OF HEROIN FOLLOWED BY 1.5 MG/KG INCREMENTS PER DAY TO A FINAL DOSE OF 13.5 MG/KG PER DAY. OFFSPRING WERE WEANED ON POSTNATAL DAY 21. THE ADULT MALE OFFSPRING FROM EACH GENERATION WERE THEN MATED WITH FEMALE-NAVE RATS AFTER 2 WEEKS OF HEROIN ABSENCE. OPEN FIELD TEST AND ELEVATED PLUS MAZE TEST WERE USED TO STUDY THE ANXIETY LEVEL, WHEREAS RESIDENT INTRUDER TEST WAS USED TO EVALUATE AGGRESSION LEVEL IN THE ADDICTED MALE RATS AND THEIR OFFSPRING. RESULTS: HEROIN EXPOSURE IN MALE RATS HAD RESULTED IN SMALLER SIZES OF THE LITTERS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. WE OBSERVED A HIGHER ANXIETY LEVEL IN THE F1 AND F2 PROGENIES SIRED BY THE HEROIN EXPOSED RATS (F0) AS COMPARED TO THE CONTROL RATS. PATERNAL HEROIN EXPOSURE ALSO CAUSED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AGGRESSIVE OFFSPRING IN F1 COMPARED TO THE CONTROL. THE SAME PATTERN WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE F2. CONCLUSION: OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATED THAT THE PROGENIES OF F1 AND F2 SUSTAINED HIGHER LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND AGGRESSION WHICH ARE DUE TO PATERNAL HEROIN EXPOSURE. 2016 THE AUTHOR(S).","23","DIAMORPHINE, 1502-95-0, 561-27-3; SODIUM CHLORIDE, 7647-14-5",NA,"JAMES, R.J.; UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MARA SELANGOR, INTEGRATIVE PHARMACOGENOMICS INSTITUTE (IPROMISE), LEVEL 7, FF3, PUNCAK ALAM CAMPUS, MALAYSIA; EMAIL: RITCHJJ@YAHOO.FR","ARTICLE","10.1186/s12993-016-0107-y",NA,"17449081","BEHAVIORAL AND BRAIN FUNCTIONS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,3,"1",NA,NA,"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.","27582026","SCOPUS","TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF PATERNAL HEROIN ADDICTION ON ANXIETY AND AGGRESSION BEHAVIOR IN MALE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84987723130&doi=10.1186%2fs12993-016-0107-y&partnerID=40&md5=5d6006737862da7b26ce798bbd6fa1a4","12",2016,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MARA SELANGOR;UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MARA SELANGOR;UNIVERSITI PUTRA MALAYSIA","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITI TEKNOLOGI MARA SELANGOR;NOTREPORTED",NA,"FARAH NAQUIAH MZ, 2016, BEHAV BRAIN FUNCT","FARAH NAQUIAH MZ, 2016, BEHAV BRAIN FUNCT"

AGRIBUSINESS IS THE ECONOMIC BASIS OF THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO, THE LARGEST CONSUMER OF PESTICIDES OF ALL BRAZILIAN STATES. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PAST PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES AND THE OCCURRENCE OF CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS IN CHILDREN IN MATO GROSSO, BRAZIL. METHODS: THIS HOSPITAL-BASED CASE-CONTROL STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN CUIAB, THE CAPITAL OF MATO GROSSO, FROM MARCH TO OCTOBER 2011. DATA WAS COLLECTED IN ALL PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND HEALTH PLAN REFERRAL HOSPITALS THAT PROVIDE CARE FOR PREGNANT WOMEN IN THE STATE OF MATO GROSSO AND WERE SITUATED IN CUIAB. CASES WERE CHILDREN UNDER 5 YEARS OF AGE WITH CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS CLASSIFIED IN CHAPTER XVIII OF THE INTERNATIONAL CLASSIFICATION OF DISEASES-10 AND CONTROLS WERE CHILDREN WITHIN THE SAME AGE RANGE, WITHOUT CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS, TREATED AT THE SAME HOSPITALS. MALFORMATION-RELATED DATA WAS OBTAINED FROM THE PATIENTS' MEDICAL RECORDS. SOCIOECONOMIC DATA AND INFORMATION ABOUT PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES WERE OBTAINED IN AN INTERVIEW WITH THE MOTHER USING A STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRE. WE CONDUCTED MULTIVARIATE LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO ASSESS THE RELATION BETWEEN PARENT REPORT OF PAST PESTICIDE USE AND CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS. WE ALSO ASSESSED EFFECT MODIFICATION TO VERIFY WHETHER LOW MATERNAL EDUCATION LEVEL MODIFIED THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN EXPOSURE AND OUR OUTCOME. RESULTS: WE OBSERVED POSITIVE EFFECT MODIFICATION OF THE ASSOCIATION OF PATERNAL PAST EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDE AND CONGENITAL MALFORMATION IN THE OFFSPRING BY MATERNAL EDUCATION FOR MOTHERS WITH LOW EDUCATIONAL LEVEL (OR = 8.40, 95 % CI 2.17-32.52), FATHER'S WORK RELATED TO FARMING (OR = 4.65, 95 % CI 1.03-20.98) AND PATERNAL PAST EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES (OR = 4.15, 95 % CI 1.24-13.66). CONCLUSION: THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE FURTHER EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES, ESPECIALLY WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW MATERNAL EDUCATION LEVEL, MAY BE RELATED TO HIGHER RATES OF FETAL MALFORMATION IN MATO GROSSO, BRAZIL. 2016 UEKER ET AL.","125","PESTICIDES","BPMEB","SILVA, A.M.C.; FEDERAL UNIVERSITY OF MATO GROSSO (UFMT), INSTITUTE OF COLLECTIVE HEALTH, AV.

ANIM. ECOL., 80, PP. 1174-118","ZOOLOGY","THE TRANSFER OF IMMUNITY FROM PARENTS TO OFFSPRING (TRANS-GENERATIONAL IMMUNE PRIMING (TGIP)) BOOSTS OFFSPRING IMMUNE DEFENCE AND PARASITE RESISTANCE. TGIP IS USUALLY A MATERNAL TRAIT. HOWEVER, IF FATHERS HAVE A PHYSICAL CONNECTION TO THEIR OFFSPRING, AND IF OFFSPRING ARE BORN IN THE PATERNAL PARASITIC ENVIRONMENT, EVOLUTION OF PATERNAL TGIP CAN BECOME ADAPTIVE. IN SYNGNATHUS TYPHLE, A SEX-ROLE REVERSED PIPEFISH WITH MALE PREGNANCY, BOTH PARENTS INVEST INTO OFFSPRING IMMUNE DEFENCE. TO CONNECT TGIP WITH PARENTAL INVESTMENT, WE NEED TO KNOW HOW PARENTS SHARE THE TASK OF TGIP, WHETHER TGIP IS ASYMMETRICALLY DISTRIBUTED BETWEEN THE PARENTS, AND HOW THE MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EFFECTS INTERACT IN CASE OF BIPARENTAL TGIP. WE EXPERIMENTALLY INVESTIGATED THE STRENGTH AND DIFFERENCES BUT ALSO THE COSTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL CONTRIBUTION, AND THEIR INTERACTIVE BIPARENTAL INFLUENCE ON OFFSPRING IMMUNE DEFENCE THROUGHOUT OFFSPRING MATURATION. TO DISENTANGLE MATERNAL AND PATERNAL INFLUENCES, TWO DIFFERENT BACTERIA WERE USED IN A FULLY RECIPROCAL DESIGN FOR PARENTAL AND OFFSPRING EXPOSURE. IN OFFSPRING, WE MEASURED GENE EXPRESSION OF 29 IMMUNE GENES, 15 GENES ASSOCIATED WITH EPIGENETIC REGULATION, IMMUNE CELL ACTIVITY AND LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS. WE IDENTIFIED ASYMMETRIC MATERNAL AND PATERNAL IMMUNE PRIMING WITH A DOMINATING, LONG-LASTING PATERNAL EFFECT. WE COULD NOT DETECT AN ADDITIVE ADAPTIVE BIPARENTAL TGIP IMPACT. HOWEVER, BIPARENTAL TGIP HARBOURS ADDITIVE COSTS AS SHOWN IN DELAYED SEXUAL MATURITY. EPIGENETIC REGULATION MAY PLAY A ROLE BOTH IN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL TGIP. 2016 THE AUTHORS",NA,"FISH PROTEINS",NA,"ROTH, O.; HELMHOLTZ CENTRE FOR OCEAN RESEARCH KIEL (GEOMAR), EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY OF MARINE FISHES, DSTERNBROOKER WEG 20, GERMANY; EMAIL: OROTH@GEOMAR.DE","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.zool.2016.06.002","DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTDEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT,SPP1399,4628/1-1 INTERNATIONAL MAX PLANCK RESEARCH SCHOOL FOR ADVANCED METHODS IN PROCESS AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERINGINTERNATIONAL MAX PLANCK RESEARCH SCHOOL FOR ADVANCED METHODS IN PROCESS AND SYSTEMS ENGINEERING DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTDEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT","09442006","ZOOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,13,"4",NA,"262-272","ELSEVIER GMBH","27477613","SCOPUS","BIPARENTAL IMMUNE PRIMING IN THE PIPEFISH SYNGNATHUS TYPHLE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84979777945&doi=10.1016%2fj.zool.2016.06.002&partnerID=40&md5=ddd7bb76ca4ea59887d402ae035ad3cb","119",2016,"WE THANK MAUDE POIRIER , SOPHIA WEGNER, MARTIN GRIMM, VERENA KLEIN, FABIAN WENDT, JOAO GLADECK, ISABEL KELLER, SUSANNE LANDIS, JOANNA MIEST, DIANA GILL, FRANZISKA BRUNNER AND ANDREA FRANKE FOR SUPPORT DURING EXPERIMENTAL FIELD AND LAB WORK.

METAB.","OBJECTIVE PARENTAL OBESITY CAN INDUCE METABOLIC PHENOTYPES IN OFFSPRING INDEPENDENT OF THE INHERITED DNA SEQUENCE. HERE WE ASKED WHETHER SUCH NON-GENETIC ACQUIRED METABOLIC TRAITS CAN BE PASSED ON TO A SECOND GENERATION THAT HAS NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO OBESITY, EVEN AS GERM CELLS. METHODS WE EXAMINED THE F1, F2, AND F3 A/A OFFSPRING DERIVED FROM F0 MATINGS OF OBESE PREDIABETIC AVY/A SIRES AND LEAN A/A DAMS. AFTER F0, ONLY LEAN A/A MICE WERE USED FOR BREEDING. RESULTS WE FOUND THAT F1 SONS OF OBESE FOUNDER MALES EXHIBITED DEFECTS IN GLUCOSE AND LIPID METABOLISM, BUT ONLY UPON A POST-WEANING DIETARY CHALLENGE. F1 MALES TRANSMITTED THESE DEFECTS TO THEIR OWN MALE PROGENY (F2) IN THE ABSENCE OF THE DIETARY CHALLENGE, BUT THE PHENOTYPE WAS LARGELY ATTENUATED BY F3. THE SPERM OF F1 MALES EXHIBITED CHANGES IN THE ABUNDANCE OF SEVERAL SMALL RNA SPECIES, INCLUDING THE RECENTLY REPORTED DIET-RESPONSIVE TRNA-DERIVED FRAGMENTS. CONCLUSIONS THESE DATA INDICATE THAT INDUCED METABOLIC PHENOTYPES MAY BE PROPAGATED FOR A GENERATION BEYOND ANY DIRECT EXPOSURE TO AN INDUCING FACTOR. THIS NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE LIKELY OCCURS VIA THE ACTIONS OF SPERM NONCODING RNA. 2016 THE AUTHOR(S)",NA,"INSULIN, 9004-10-8; TRANSFER RNA, 9014-25-9",NA,"SUTER, C.M.; MOLECULAR, STRUCTURAL AND COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY DIVISION, VICTOR CHANG CARDIAC RESEARCH INSTITUTEAUSTRALIA; EMAIL: C.SUTER@VICTORCHANG.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.molmet.2016.06.008","AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCILAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL,FT110100455,DE120100723 DP120100825,ARC DP130103027 FT120100097 NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCILNATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL,APP1021168 VICTOR CHANG CARDIAC RESEARCH INSTITUTEVICTOR CHANG CARDIAC RESEARCH INSTITUTE","22128778","MOLECULAR METABOLISM","ENGLISH",NA,NA,48,"8",NA,"699-708","ELSEVIER GMBH",NA,"SCOPUS","MALE-LINEAGE TRANSMISSION OF AN ACQUIRED METABOLIC PHENOTYPE INDUCED BY GRAND-PATERNAL OBESITY",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978902230&doi=10.1016%2fj.molmet.2016.06.008&partnerID=40&md5=36c3fe1a37a663e0cb2d3fc4ccf80d58","5",2016,"RAW SEQUENCING DATA HAS BEEN DEPOSITED IN THE NCBI SEQUENCING READ ARCHIVE UNDER STUDY ACCESSION SRP051542.

WHILE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL MALNUTRITION MAY INCREASE OFFSPRING SUSCEPTIBILITY TO METABOLIC DISEASES, THE INFLUENCE OF PATERNAL FACTORS ON A DAUGHTER'S BREAST CANCER RISK HAS BEEN EXAMINED IN FEW STUDIES. METHODS: MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE FED, BEFORE AND DURING PUBERTY, EITHER A LARD-BASED (HIGH IN SATURATED FATS) OR A CORN OIL-BASED (HIGH IN N-6 POLYUNSATURATED FATS) HIGH-FAT DIET (60 % OF FAT-DERIVED ENERGY). CONTROL ANIMALS WERE FED AN AIN-93G CONTROL DIET (16 % OF FAT-DERIVED ENERGY). THEIR 50-DAY-OLD FEMALE OFFSPRING FED ONLY A COMMERCIAL DIET WERE SUBJECTED TO THE CLASSICAL MODEL OF MAMMARY CARCINOGENESIS BASED ON 7,12-DIMETHYLBENZ[A]ANTHRACENE INITIATION, AND MAMMARY TUMOR DEVELOPMENT WAS EVALUATED. SPERM CELLS AND MAMMARY GLAND TISSUE WERE SUBJECTED TO CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR ANALYSIS. RESULTS: COMPARED WITH FEMALE OFFSPRING OF CONTROL DIET-FED MALE RATS, OFFSPRING OF LARD-FED MALE RATS DID NOT DIFFER IN TUMOR LATENCY, GROWTH, OR MULTIPLICITY. HOWEVER, FEMALE OFFSPRING OF LARD-FED MALE RATS HAD INCREASED ELONGATION OF THE MAMMARY EPITHELIAL TREE, NUMBER OF TERMINAL END BUDS, AND TUMOR INCIDENCE COMPARED WITH BOTH FEMALE OFFSPRING OF CONTROL DIET-FED AND CORN OIL-FED MALE RATS. COMPARED WITH FEMALE OFFSPRING OF CONTROL DIET-FED MALE RATS, FEMALE OFFSPRING OF CORN OIL-FED MALE RATS SHOWED DECREASED TUMOR GROWTH BUT NO DIFFERENCE REGARDING TUMOR INCIDENCE, LATENCY, OR MULTIPLICITY. ADDITIONALLY, FEMALE OFFSPRING OF CORN OIL-FED MALE RATS HAD LONGER TUMOR LATENCY AS WELL AS DECREASED TUMOR GROWTH AND MULTIPLICITY COMPARED WITH FEMALE OFFSPRING OF LARD-FED MALE RATS. PATERNAL CONSUMPTION OF ANIMAL- OR PLANT-BASED HIGH-FAT DIETS ELICITED OPPOSING EFFECTS, WITH LARD RICH IN SATURATED FATTY ACIDS INCREASING BREAST CANCER RISK IN OFFSPRING AND CORN OIL RICH IN N-6 POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS DECREASING IT. THESE EFFECTS COULD BE LINKED TO ALTERATIONS IN MICRORNA EXPRESSION IN FATHERS' SPERM AND THEIR DAUGHTERS' MAMMARY GLANDS, AND TO MODIFICATIONS IN BREAST CANCER-RELATED PROTEIN EXPRESSION IN THIS TISSUE.

J. PHYSIOL. ENDOCRINOL. METAB.","RECENT STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT EPIGENETIC CHANGES RESULTING FROM MALNUTRITION MIGHT PLAY IMPORTANT ROLES IN TRANSGENERATIONAL LINKS WITH METABOLIC DISEASES. PREVIOUSLY, WE OBSERVED THAT EXPOSURE TO A HIGH-FAT DIET (HFD) IN UTERO CAUSED A METABOLIC SYNDROME-LIKE PHENOMENON THROUGH EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS OF THE ADIPONECTIN AND LEPTIN GENES THAT PERSISTED FOR MULTIPLE GENERATIONS. RECENT ETIOLOGICAL STUDIES INDICATED THAT PATERNAL BMI HAD EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING BMI THAT WERE INDEPENDENT OF BUT ADDITIVE TO MATERNAL BMI EFFECTS. THUS, WE EXAMINED WHETHER PATERNAL HFD-INDUCED OBESITY AFFECTED THE METABOLIC STATUS OF OFFSPRING THROUGH EPIGENETIC CHANGES IN THE ADIPONECTIN AND LEPTIN GENES. ADDITIONALLY, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER A NORMAL DIET DURING SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS ABOLISHED THE EPIGENETIC CHANGES ASSOCIATED WITH PATERNAL HFD EXPOSURE BEFORE CONCEPTION. WE OBSERVED THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL HFD EXPOSURE BEFORE CONCEPTION OVER MULTIPLE GENERATIONS ON OFFSPRING METABOLIC TRAITS, INCLUDING WEIGHT AND FAT GAIN, GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE, HYPERTRIGLYCERIDEMIA, ABNORMAL ADIPOCYTOKINE LEVELS, HYPERTENSION, AND ADIPONECTIN AND LEPTIN GENE EXPRESSION AND EPIGENETIC CHANGES. NORMAL DIET CONSUMPTION BY MALE OFFSPRING DURING THE SUBSEQUENT GENERATION FOLLOWING PATERNAL HFD EXPOSURE DIMINISHED WHEREAS CONSUMPTION FOR TWO GENERATIONS COMPLETELY ABOLISHED THE EFFECT OF PATERNAL HFD EXPOSURE ON METABOLIC TRAITS AND ADIPOCYTOKINE PROMOTER EPIGENETIC CHANGES IN THE OFFSPRING. THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL HFD EXPOSURE ON OFFSPRING WERE RELATIVELY WEAKER THAN THOSE FOLLOWING HFD EXPOSURE IN UTERO. HOWEVER, PATERNAL HFD EXPOSURE HAD AN ADDITIVE METABOLIC EFFECT FOR TWO GENERATIONS, SUGGESTING THAT BOTH PATERNAL AND MATERNAL NUTRITION MIGHT AFFECT OFFSPRING METABOLISM THROUGH EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS OF ADIPOCYTOKINE GENES FOR MULTIPLE GENERATIONS. 2016 THE AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY.",NA,"ADIPONECTIN, 283182-39-8","AJPMD","MASUYAMA, H.; DEPT.

HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE (PAE) ON OFFSPRING ETOH SENSITIVITY AND NEUROTROPHINS HAS NOT RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION. THE PRESENT STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER PAE MAY DISRUPT NERVE GROWTH FACTOR (NGF) AND/OR BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) AND AFFECT ETOH PREFERENCE/REWARDING PROPERTIES IN THE MALE OFFSPRING. CD1 SIRE MICE WERE CHRONICALLY ADDICTED FOR ETOH OR ADMINISTERED WITH SUCROSE. THEIR MALE OFFSPRINGS WHEN ADULT WERE ASSESSED FOR ETOH PREFERENCE BY A CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE PARADIGM. NGF AND BDNF, THEIR RECEPTORS (P75NTR, TRKA AND TRKB), DOPAMINE ACTIVE TRANSPORTER (DAT), DOPAMINE RECEPTORS D1 AND D2, PRO-NGF AND PRO-BDNF WERE ALSO EVALUATED IN BRAIN AREAS. PAE AFFECTED NGF LEVELS IN FRONTAL CORTEX, STRIATUM, OLFACTORY LOBES, HIPPOCAMPUS AND HYPOTHALAMUS. BDNF ALTERATIONS IN FRONTAL CORTEX, STRIATUM AND OLFACTORY LOBES WERE FOUND. PAE INDUCED A HIGHER SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE ETOH REWARDING EFFECTS MOSTLY EVIDENT AT THE LOWER CONCENTRATION (0.5 G/KG) THAT WAS INEFFECTIVE IN NON-PAE OFFSPRINGS. MOREOVER, HIGHER ETHANOL CONCENTRATIONS (1.5 G/KG) PRODUCED AN AVERSIVE RESPONSE IN PAE ANIMALS AND A SIGNIFICANT PREFERENCE IN NON-PAE OFFSPRING. PAE AFFECTED ALSO TRKA IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND P75NTR IN THE FRONTAL CORTEX. DAT WAS AFFECTED IN THE OLFACTORY LOBES IN PAE ANIMALS TREATED WITH 0.5 G/KG OF ETHANOL WHILE NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND ON D1/D2 RECEPTORS AND FOR PRO-NGF OR PRO-BDNF.

BIOL.","WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT PATERNAL COCAINE EXPOSURE REDUCED THE REINFORCING EFFICACY OF COCAINE IN MALE OFFSPRING. HERE, WE SOUGHT TO DETERMINE WHETHER PATERNAL COCAINE EXPERIENCE COULD ALSO INFLUENCE ANXIETY LEVELS IN OFFSPRING. MALE RATS WERE ALLOWED TO SELF-ADMINISTER COCAINE (CONTROLS RECEIVED SALINE PASSIVELY) FOR 60 DAYS AND THEN WERE BRED WITH NAVE FEMALES. MEASURES OF ANXIETY AND COCAINE-INDUCED ANXIOGENIC EFFECTS WERE ASSESSED IN THE ADULT OFFSPRING. COCAINE-SIRED MALE OFFSPRING EXHIBITED INCREASED ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORS, AS MEASURED USING THE NOVELTY-INDUCED HYPOPHAGIA AND DEFENSIVE BURYING TASKS, RELATIVE TO SALINE-SIRED MALES. IN CONTRAST, SIRE COCAINE EXPERIENCE HAD NO EFFECT ON ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORS IN FEMALE OFFSPRING. WHEN CHALLENGED WITH AN ANXIOGENIC (BUT NOT ANORECTIC) DOSE OF COCAINE (2.5 MG/KG, I.P.), ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR WAS ENHANCED IN ALL ANIMALS TO AN EQUAL DEGREE REGARDLESS OF SIRE DRUG EXPERIENCE. SINCE ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ARE OFTEN CO-MORBID, WE ALSO ASSESSED MEASURES OF DEPRESSIVE-LIKE BEHAVIOR. SIRE COCAINE EXPERIENCE HAD NO EFFECT ON DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIORS, AS MEASURED BY THE FORCED SWIM TASK, AMONG MALE OFFSPRING. IN A SEPARATE GROUP OF NAVE LITTERMATES, SELECT NEURONAL CORRELATES OF ANXIETY WERE MEASURED. MALE OFFSPRING OF COCAINE-EXPERIENCED SIRES SHOWED INCREASED MRNA AND PROTEIN EXPRESSION OF CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING FACTOR RECEPTOR 2 IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS. TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT COCAINE-EXPERIENCED SIRES PRODUCE MALE PROGENY THAT HAVE INCREASED BASELINE ANXIETY, WHICH IS UNALTERED BY SUBSEQUENT COCAINE EXPOSURE. 2015 SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF ADDICTION",NA,"COCAINE, 50-36-2, 53-21-4, 5937-29-1; CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING FACTOR, 9015-71-8, 178359-01-8, 79804-71-0, 86297-72-5, 86784-80-7","ADBIF","WIMMER, M.E.; CENTER FOR NEUROBIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR, DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, PERELMAN SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIAUNITED STATES; EMAIL: MWIMMER@MAIL.MED.UPENN.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1111/adb.12258",NA,"13556215","ADDICTION BIOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,13,"4",NA,"802-810","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","25923597","SCOPUS","ENHANCED ANXIETY IN THE MALE OFFSPRING OF SIRES THAT SELF-ADMINISTERED COCAINE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84975063126&doi=10.1111%2fadb.12258&partnerID=40&md5=3f3a5f2a4a865f19824ee84e9235e69f","21",2016,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA;TUFTS UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIAUNITED STATES;NOTREPORTED",NA,"WHITE SL, 2016, ADDICT BIOL","WHITE SL, 2016, ADDICT BIOL"

ECOL.","FOR MOST ORGANISMS, EARLY LIFE-HISTORY STAGES ARE THE MOST SENSITIVE TO ENVIRONMENTAL STRESS AND SO TRANSGENERATIONAL PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY, WHEREBY THE PARENTAL ENVIRONMENT AND OFFSPRING ENVIRONMENT INTERACT TO ALTER THE PHENOTYPE OF THE OFFSPRING, IS VIEWED AS KEY TO PROMOTING PERSISTENCE IN THE FACE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. WHILE THERE HAS BEEN LONG-STANDING INTEREST IN THE ROLE OF TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY VIA THE MATERNAL LINE (TRADITIONALLY THE FIELD OF MATERNAL EFFECTS), INCREASINGLY IT APPEARS THAT PATERNAL EFFECTS CAN ALSO PLAY A ROLE. DESPITE THE EMERGING ROLE OF PATERNAL EFFECTS IN STUDIES OF GLOBAL CHANGE, KEY KNOWLEDGE GAPS REMAIN: FIRST, WHETHER PATERNAL EFFECTS ACT TO INCREASE OR DECREASE OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE REMAINS LARGELY UNEXPLORED; SECOND, THE RELATIVE ROLES OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EFFECTS ARE RARELY DISENTANGLED; AND THIRD, THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION, A KEY DETERMINANT OF THE BENEFITS OF TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY, HAS NOT BEEN EXPLORED WITH REGARD TO PATERNAL EFFECTS. HERE, WE EXPLORE ALL THREE ISSUES USING THE MARINE TUBEWORM GALEOLARIA CAESPITOSA, AN IMPORTANT HABITAT-FORMING SPECIES IN SOUTHERN AUSTRALIA. WE FOUND THAT BOTH PATERNAL AND MATERNAL EXPERIENCES AFFECTED KEY STAGES OF OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE (FERTILIZATION AND LARVAL DEVELOPMENT) AND, SURPRISINGLY, PATERNAL EFFECTS WERE OFTEN STRONGER THAN MATERNAL EFFECTS. FURTHERMORE, WE FOUND THAT PATERNAL EFFECTS OFTEN REDUCED OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE, ESPECIALLY WHEN ENVIRONMENTS VARIED COMPARED WITH WHEN ENVIRONMENTS WERE STABLE. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT, WHILE TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY MAY PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MODIFYING THE IMPACTS OF GLOBAL CHANGE, THESE EFFECTS ARE NOT UNIFORMLY POSITIVE. IMPORTANTLY, PATERNAL EFFECTS CAN BE AS STRONG, OR STRONGER, THAN MATERNAL EFFECTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABILITY STRONGLY ALTERS THE IMPACTS OF PATERNAL EFFECTS. 2015 THE AUTHORS.

FOR INSTANCE, PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION EXPOSURES TO ETHANOL OR STRESS HAVE INDEPENDENTLY BEEN SHOWN TO EXERT SUCH INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS. SINCE ETHANOL EXPOSURE IS A PHYSIOLOGICAL STRESSOR THAT ACTIVATES THE HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS, WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT PATERNAL ETHANOL EXPOSURE WOULD IMPACT STRESS RESPONSIVITY OF OFFSPRING. ADULT MALE MICE WERE EXPOSED TO CHRONIC INTERMITTENT VAPOR ETHANOL OR CONTROL CONDITIONS FOR 5 WEEKS BEFORE BEING MATED WITH ETHANOL-NAVE FEMALES TO PRODUCE ETHANOL (E)- AND CONTROL (C)-SIRED OFFSPRING. ADULT MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING WERE TESTED FOR PLASMA CORTICOSTERONE (CORT) LEVELS FOLLOWING ACUTE RESTRAINT STRESS AND THE MALE OFFSPRING WERE FURTHER EXAMINED FOR STRESS-EVOKED 2-BOTTLE CHOICE ETHANOL-DRINKING. PATERNAL ETHANOL EXPOSURE BLUNTED PLASMA CORT LEVELS FOLLOWING ACUTE RESTRAINT STRESS SELECTIVELY IN MALE OFFSPRING; FEMALES WERE UNAFFECTED. IN A STRESS-EVOKED ETHANOL-DRINKING ASSAY, THERE WAS NO EFFECT OF STRESS ON ETHANOL CONSUMPTION. HOWEVER, C-SIRED MALES EXHIBITED INCREASED TOTAL FLUID INTAKE (POLYDIPSIA) IN RESPONSE TO STRESS WHILE E-SIRED MALES WERE RESISTANT TO THIS STRESS-INDUCED PHENOTYPE. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT PATERNAL ETHANOL EXPOSURE IMPARTS STRESS HYPORESPONSIVITY TO MALE OFFSPRING. 2016 ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; ALCOHOL, 64-17-5; ETHANOL","ALCOE","HOMANICS, G.E.; UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH, BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE TOWER-3, 3501 FIFTH AVENUE, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: HOMANICSGE@ANES.UPMC.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.alcohol.2016.03.006","NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISMNATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL ABUSE AND ALCOHOLISM,R37AA010422,AA021632","07418329","ALCOHOL","ENGLISH",NA,NA,15,NA,NA,"19-25","ELSEVIER INC.","27286933","SCOPUS","PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION ETHANOL EXPOSURE BLUNTS HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL AXIS RESPONSIVITY AND STRESS-INDUCED EXCESSIVE FLUID INTAKE IN MALE MICE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84965037281&doi=10.1016%2fj.alcohol.2016.03.006&partnerID=40&md5=397065cb9f66e0166ac03367e2c39440","53",2016,"WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK CAROLYN FERGUSON AND DANIEL FARRELL FOR PROVIDING EXPERT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

EPIGENETIC STUDIES IN WILD MAMMALS ARE RARE, BUT ENABLE UNDERSTANDING ADAPTATION PROCESSES AS THEY MAY OCCUR IN NATURE. IN MOST WILD MAMMAL SPECIES, MALES ARE THE DISPERSING SEX AND THUS OFTEN HAVE TO COPE WITH DIFFERING HABITATS AND THERMAL CHANGES MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE OFTEN PHILOPATRIC FEMALES. AS TEMPERATURE IS A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL SELECTION FACTOR, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER GENETICALLY HETEROGENEOUS WILD GUINEA PIG (CAVIA APEREA) MALES ADAPT EPIGENETICALLY TO AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE, WHETHER THAT RESPONSE WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE NEXT GENERATION(S), AND WHETHER IT REGULATES MRNA EXPRESSION. FIVE (F0) ADULT MALE GUINEA PIGS WERE EXPOSED TO AN INCREASED AMBIENT TEMPERATURE FOR 2 MONTHS, CORRESPONDING TO THE DURATION OF THE SPECIES' SPERMATOGENESIS. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF HEAT, WE FOCUSED ON THE MAIN THERMOREGULATORY ORGAN, THE LIVER. WE ANALYZED CPG-METHYLATION CHANGES OF MALE OFFSPRING (F1) SIRED BEFORE AND AFTER THE FATHERS' HEAT TREATMENT (AS HAS RECENTLY BEEN DESCRIBED IN WEYRICH ET AL. [MOL. ECOL., 2015]). TRANSCRIPTION ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED FOR THE THREE GENES WITH THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED CHANGES DETECTED: THE THERMOREGULATION GENE SIGNAL TRANSDUCER AND ACTIVATOR OF TRANSCRIPTION 3 (STAT3), THE PROTEOLYTIC PEPTIDASE GENE CATHEPSIN Z (CTSZ), AND SIRTUIN 6 (SIRT6) WITH FUNCTION IN EPIGENETIC REGULATION. STAT3 GENE EXPRESSION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED (P < 0.05), WHICH INDICATED A CLOSE LINK BETWEEN CPG-METHYLATION AND EXPRESSION LEVELS FOR THIS GENE. THE TWO OTHER GENES DID NOT SHOW GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THE PRESENCE OF A PATERNAL TRANSGENERATIONAL EPIGENETIC EFFECT. QUICK ADAPTATION TO CLIMATIC CHANGES MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY RELEVANT FOR THE SURVIVAL OF WILDLIFE SPECIES AS GLOBAL TEMPERATURES ARE RISING. 2016 PUBLISHED BY JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.",NA,NA,NA,"WEYRICH, A.; LEIBNIZ-INSTITUTE FOR ZOO AND WILDLIFE RESEARCH (IZW), ALFRED-KOWALKE-STR. 17, GERMANY; EMAIL: WEYRICH@IZW-BERLIN.DE","ARTICLE","10.1002/ece3.1993",NA,"20457758","ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,8,"9",NA,"2657-2666","JOHN WILEY AND SONS LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","PATERNAL HEAT EXPOSURE CAUSES DNA METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES OF STAT3 IN WILD GUINEA PIG SONS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84959432485&doi=10.1002%2fece3.1993&partnerID=40&md5=1e123d9bb1fcb8def313d03ab33b3f3b","6",2016,"NA NA NA","LEIBNIZ-INSTITUTE FOR ZOO AND WILDLIFE RESEARCH (IZW);BERLIN CENTER FOR GENOMICS IN BIODIVERSITY RESEARCH;POTSDAM UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;LEIBNIZ-INSTITUTE FOR ZOO AND WILDLIFE RESEARCH (IZW);NOTREPORTED",NA,"WEYRICH A, 2016, ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION","WEYRICH A, 2016, ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION"

HOWEVER, INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF THIS ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION REMAINS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. HERE, USING A C57BL/6 MOUSE MODEL OF RESTRAINT STRESS, WE SHOW THAT OFFSPRING OF STRESSED FATHERS EXHIBIT HYPERGLYCEMIA DUE TO ENHANCED HEPATIC GLUCONEOGENESIS AND ELEVATED EXPRESSION OF PEPCK. MECHANISTICALLY, WE IDENTIFY AN EPIGENETIC ALTERATION AT THE PROMOTER REGION OF THE SFMBT2 GENE, A MATERNALLY IMPRINTED POLYCOMB GENE, LEADING TO A DOWNREGULATION OF INTRONIC MICRORNA-466B-3P, WHICH POST-TRANSCRIPTIONALLY INHIBITS PEPCK EXPRESSION. IMPORTANTLY, HYPERGLYCEMIA IN F1 MICE IS REVERSED BY RU486 TREATMENT IN FATHERS, AND DEXAMETHASONE ADMINISTRATION IN F0 MICE PHENOCOPIES THE ROLES OF RESTRAINT STRESS.

ECOL.","EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS, OF WHICH DNA METHYLATION IS THE BEST STUDIED ONE, CAN CONVEY ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION THROUGH GENERATIONS VIA PARENTAL GERM LINES. PAST STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE MATERNAL TRANSMISSION OF EPIGENETIC INFORMATION TO THE OFFSPRING OF ISOGENIC MICE AND RATS IN RESPONSE TO EXTERNAL CHANGES, WHEREAS HETEROGENEOUS WILD MAMMALS AS WELL AS PATERNAL EPIGENETIC EFFECTS HAVE BEEN WIDELY NEGLECTED. IN MOST WILD MAMMAL SPECIES, MALES ARE THE DISPERSING SEX AND HAVE TO COPE WITH DIFFERING HABITATS AND THERMAL CHANGES. AS TEMPERATURE IS A MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL FACTOR WE INVESTIGATED IF GENETICALLY HETEROGENEOUS WILD GUINEA PIG (CAVIA APEREA) MALES CAN ADAPT EPIGENETICALLY TO AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE AND IF THAT RESPONSE WILL BE TRANSMITTED TO THE NEXT GENERATION(S). FIVE ADULT MALE GUINEA PIGS (F0) WERE EXPOSED TO AN INCREASED AMBIENT TEMPERATURE FOR 2 MONTHS, I.E. THE DURATION OF SPERMATOGENESIS. WE STUDIED THE LIVER (AS THE MAIN THERMOREGULATORY ORGAN) OF F0 FATHERS AND F1 SONS, AND TESTES OF F1 SONS FOR PATERNAL TRANSMISSION OF EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS ACROSS GENERATION(S). REDUCED REPRESENTATION BISULPHITE SEQUENCING REVEALED SHARED DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED REGIONS IN ANNOTATED AREAS BETWEEN F0 LIVERS BEFORE AND AFTER HEAT TREATMENT, AND THEIR SONS' LIVERS AND TESTES, WHICH INDICATED A GENERAL RESPONSE WITH ECOLOGICAL RELEVANCE. THUS, PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO A TEMPORALLY LIMITED INCREASED AMBIENT TEMPERATURE LED TO AN 'IMMEDIATE' AND 'HERITABLE' EPIGENETIC RESPONSE THAT MAY EVEN BE TRANSMITTED TO THE F2 GENERATION. IN THE CONTEXT OF GLOBALLY RISING TEMPERATURES EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS MAY BECOME INCREASINGLY RELEVANT FOR THE SURVIVAL OF SPECIES. 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.",NA,NA,"MOECE","WEYRICH, A.; LEIBNIZ-INSTITUTE FOR ZOO AND WILDLIFE RESEARCH (IZW), ALFRED-KOWALKE-STR. 17, GERMANY; EMAIL: WEYRICH@IZW-BERLIN.DE","ARTICLE","10.1111/mec.13494",NA,"09621083","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,"GENBANK: DQ006802",18,"8",NA,"1729-1740","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","26686986","SCOPUS","PATERNAL INTERGENERATIONAL EPIGENETIC RESPONSE TO HEAT EXPOSURE IN MALE WILD GUINEA PIGS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84964523901&doi=10.1111%2fmec.13494&partnerID=40&md5=83cc3e74fd9a7199e2411ab17c30ed9e","25",2016,"NA NA NA","LEIBNIZ-INSTITUTE FOR ZOO AND WILDLIFE RESEARCH (IZW);BERLIN CENTER FOR GENOMICS IN BIODIVERSITY RESEARCH;ZYMORESEARCH;POTSDAM UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;LEIBNIZ-INSTITUTE FOR ZOO AND WILDLIFE RESEARCH (IZW);NOTREPORTED",NA,"WEYRICH A, 2016, MOL ECOL","WEYRICH A, 2016, MOL ECOL"

CP-PATERNAL EXPOSURE RESULTED IN ADVERSE EFFECTS IN F1 MALE OFFSPRING. IN THIS STUDY, F1 FEMALE OFFSPRING WAS ASSESSED FOR REPRODUCTIVE DEVELOPMENT AFTER CP-PATERNAL EXPOSURE. PERI-PUBERTAL MALE RATS, TREATED WITH 1 MG/KG/DAY OF CP OR VEHICLE FOR 3 WEEKS, WERE MATED WITH UNEXPOSED FEMALES. F1 FEMALE OFFSPRING OF CP-TREATED FATHERS SHOWED A DECREASE IN FETAL OVARY GERM CELLS, IN ESTROUS CYCLE LENGTH AND FSH LEVELS, AND AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF ANTRAL FOLLICLES IN ADULTS.

METAB. (LOND), 10, P. ","FASEB J.","OBESITY HASMORE THAN DOUBLED IN CHILDREN AND TRIPLED IN ADOLESCENTS IN THE PAST 30 YR. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN METABOLIC DISORDERS IN OFFSPRING OF OBESE MOTHERS WITH DIABETES HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN; HOWEVER, A GROWING BODY OF RESEARCH INDICATES THAT FATHERS PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE THROUGH PRESENTLY UNKNOWN MECHANISMS. RECENT OBSERVATIONS HAVE SHOWN THAT CHANGES IN PATERNAL DIET MAY RESULT IN TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE OF THE INSULINRESISTANT PHENOTYPE. ALTHOUGH DIET-INDUCED EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING VIA PATERNAL LINEAGE HAS RECENTLY RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION IN THE LITERATURE, THE EFFECT OF PATERNAL PHYSICAL ACTIVITY ON OFFSPRING METABOLISM HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY ADDRESSED. IN THE CURRENT STUDY,WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM VOLUNTARY WHEEL-RUNNING IN C57BL/6J MALE MICE ON THEIR OFFSPRING'S PREDISPOSITION TO INSULIN RESISTANCE. OUR OBSERVATIONS REVEALED THAT FATHERS SUBJECTED TO WHEEL-RUNNING FOR 12 WK PRODUCED OFFSPRING THAT WERE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF A HIGHFAT DIET, MANIFESTED IN INCREASED BODY WEIGHT AND ADIPOSITY, IMPAIRED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE, AND ELEVATED INSULIN LEVELS. LONG-TERM PATERNAL EXERCISE ALSO ALTERED EXPRESSION OF SEVERAL METABOLIC GENES, INCLUDING OGT, OGA, PDK4, H19, GLUT4, AND PTPN1, IN OFFSPRING SKELETAL MUSCLE. FINALLY, PROLONGED EXERCISE AFFECTED GENE METHYLATION PATTERNS AND MICRO-RNA CONTENT IN THE SPERM OF FATHERS, PROVIDING A POTENTIAL MECHANISM FOR THE TRANSGENERATIONAL INHERITANCE. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PATERNAL EXERCISE PRODUCES OFFSPRING WITH A THRIFTY PHENOTYPE, POTENTIALLY VIA MIRNA-INDUCEDMODIFICATION OF SPERM.

NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOL.","EARLY-LIFE STRESS AND BIOLOGICAL PREDISPOSITIONS ARE LINKED TO MOOD AND PERSONALITY DISORDERS RELATED TO AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR. WE PREVIOUSLY SHOWED THAT EXPOSURE TO PERIPUBERTAL STRESS LEADS TO INCREASED ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORS AND AGGRESSION AGAINST MALES AND FEMALES, AS WELL AS INCREASED AGGRESSION AGAINST FEMALES IN THEIR MALE OFFSPRING. HERE, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER PATERNAL (PS) AND INDIVIDUAL (IS) EXPOSURE TO PERIPUBERTAL STRESS MAY EXERT ADDITIVE EFFECTS ON THE LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OF ANXIETY-LIKE AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS IN RATS. GIVEN THE KEY ROLE OF THE LATERAL SEPTUM (LS) IN THE REGULATION OF ANXIETY AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS AND THE HYPOTHESIZED ALTERATIONS IN BALANCE BETWEEN NEURAL EXCITATION AND INHIBITION IN AGGRESSION-RELATED DISORDERS, MARKERS FOR THESE PROCESSES WERE EXAMINED IN THE LS. PERIPUBERTAL STRESS WAS APPLIED BOTH IN NAVE MALE RATS AND IN THE OFFSPRING OF PERIPUBERTALLY STRESSED MALES, AND ANXIETY-LIKE AND AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS WERE ASSESSED AT ADULTHOOD. PROTON MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY AT 6-MONTHS, AND POST-MORTEM ANALYSIS OF GLUTAMIC ACID DECARBOXYLASE 67 (GAD67) AT 12-MONTHS WERE CONDUCTED IN LS. WE CONFIRMED THAT AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR WAS INCREASED BY PS AND IS, WHILE ONLY IS INCREASED ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR. INDIVIDUAL STRESS LED TO REDUCED GABA, CONFIRMED BY REDUCED GAD67 IMMUNOLABELLING, AND INCREASED GLUTAMATE, N-ACETYL-ASPARTATE, PHOSPHOCHOLINE AND CREATINE; WHILE PS SPECIFICALLY LED TO REDUCED PHOSPHOCREATINE. PS AND IS DO NOT INTERACT AND EXERT A DIFFERENTIAL IMPACT ON THE ANALYZED ASPECTS OF BRAIN FUNCTION AND ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORS. THESE DATA SUPPORT THE VIEW THAT EARLY-LIFE STRESS CAN AFFECT THE BEHAVIORAL AND NEURODEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OF INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR OFFSPRING, WHICH MAY INVOLVE DIFFERENT NEUROBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS. 2015 ELSEVIER B.V.

MUCH LESS IS KNOWN REGARDING PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES. TO INVESTIGATE THIS, ADULT MALE RATS WERE EXPOSED TO 25% CALORIE RESTRICTION (CR) OR GLUCOCORTICOID ELEVATION (CORT; 200 G/ML OF CORTICOSTERONE IN DRINKING WATER) FOR ~6 WEEKS PRIOR TO BREEDING. ELEVATED PLUS MAZE (EPM), OPEN FIELD (OF), PREDATOR ODOR (CAT URINE), AND ACOUSTIC STARTLE/PRE-PULSE INHIBITION (AS/PPI) WERE CHARACTERISED IN THE ADULT MALE OFFSPRING. PLASMA CONCENTRATIONS OF CORTICOTROPHIN-RELEASING HORMONE (CRF), ADRENOCORTICOTROPIN HORMONE (ACTH), AND SERUM LEPIN WERE CHARACTERISED IN BOTH SIRES AND OFFSPRING. MATERNAL CARE RECEIVED BY LITTERS WAS ADDITIONALLY OBSERVED. EXPECTEDLY, CR AND CORT TREATMENT ATTENUATED WEIGHT GAIN, WHILST ONLY CR INDUCED ANXIOLYTIC BEHAVIOR IN THE EPM. THE ADULT OFFSPRING SIRED BY CR MALES ALSO DEMONSTRATED A REDUCTION IN WEIGHT GAIN, FOOD INTAKE AND SERUM LEPTIN LEVELS WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROLS. MOREOVER, CR OFFSPRING DEMONSTRATED AN ANXIOLYTIC-LIKE PROFILE IN THE EPM AND OF, ENHANCED HABITUATION TO THE AS PULSE, REDUCED PPI, BUT NO ALTERATION TO PREDATOR ODOR INDUCED DEFENSIVENESS COMPARED TO CONTROL. CORT OFFSPRING FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE ANY BEHAVIORAL DIFFERENCES FROM CONTROLS, HOWEVER, EXHIBITED A TREND TOWARDS REDUCED ACTH AND LEPTIN CONCENTRATION. COLLECTIVELY, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT A REDUCTION IN CALORIES IN MALES PRIOR TO CONCEPTION CAN AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF ADULT OFFSPRING. THE PHENOTYPIC TRANSMISSION OF CR EXPERIENCES FROM FATHERS TO THE PROGENY COULD POTENTIALLY BE MEDIATED EPIGENETICALLY.

THESE RESULTS, TOGETHER WITH OUR PREVIOUS FINDINGS, SUGGEST THAT PATERNAL STRESS EXPOSURE AND MATERNAL REARING CONDITIONS CAN INFLUENCE MATERNAL BEHAVIOR AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF DEFENSIVE RESPONSES IN OFFSPRING. 2016 KORGAN ET AL.",NA,"CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING FACTOR, 9015-71-8, 178359-01-8, 79804-71-0, 86297-72-5, 86784-80-7; RECEPTORS, CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE",NA,"PERROT, T.S.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE, DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY, LIFE SCIENCES CENTRE, 1355 OXFORD STREET, CANADA; EMAIL: TARA.PERROT@DAL.CA","ARTICLE","10.1523/ENEURO.0231-16.2016","NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADANATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA,RGPIN-2014- 04348,RGPIN-2013-436204 NOVA SCOTIA HEALTH RESEARCH FOUNDATIONNOVA SCOTIA HEALTH RESEARCH FOUNDATION,MED-SS-2014-9644","23732822","ENEURO","ENGLISH",NA,NA,5,"6",NA,NA,"SOCIETY FOR NEUROSCIENCE","27896313","SCOPUS","EFFECTS OF PATERNAL PREDATION RISK AND REARING ENVIRONMENT ON MATERNAL INVESTMENT AND DEVELOPMENT OF DEFENSIVE RESPONSES IN THE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85031903058&doi=10.1523%2fENEURO.0231-16.2016&partnerID=40&md5=f23346cb3486a0b6225f57e1ca7551d4","3",2016,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY DISCOVERY GRANTS FROM THE NATURAL SCIENCES AND ENGINEERING RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA TO T.S.P.

CROSS MATING, ON DEVELOPMENT, PROGENY FITNESS, AND REPRODUCTION OF THE COCCINELLID PREDATORY SPECIES, COCCINELLA UNDECIMPUNCTATA L. WAS INVESTIGATED. FEMALES ABILITY TO AVOID THEIR OWN EGG CANNIBALIZATION AND PREFERENTIALLY CONSUME NON-FILIAL EGGS, IN A CHOICE TEST, AND CHANGES IN CANNIBALISM PROPENSITY FOR BOTH SEXES BEFORE AND FOLLOWING MATING, BOTH TRIALS PROVIDED BY AD LIBITUM FOOD, WERE EXAMINED. EGG FERTILITY DIFFERED WHEN EACH FEMALE SUBJECTED TO ONE OF THE FOUR TREATMENTS IN WHICH NON-CANNIBALIZED MATED WITH CANNIBALIZED IN REVERSE DIRECTIONS. EGG FECUNDITY WAS IMPROVED ONLY BY PATERNAL CANNIBALISM, WHEREAS EGG VIABILITY IMPROVED BY PATERNAL AND MATERNAL CANNIBALISM. NON NON HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER EGG FERTILITY THAN OTHER MATING CROSSES. CANNIBALISM BY BOTH PARENTS ACCELERATED PUPATION AND REDUCED TOTAL DEVELOPMENTAL TIME. IN A TREATMENT HAD ONLY MATERNAL CANNIBALS, SHORTER LARVAL DEVELOPMENT, HIGHER SURVIVAL RATE, AND HEAVIER BODY SIZE OF DAUGHTERS AND SONS WERE RECORDED. INTERESTINGLY, SEX RATIO IN BOTH TREATMENTS, HAVING NON-CANNIBALS FEMALES, WAS ALMOST EQUAL AND THE SAME WAS OBSERVED IN TREATMENTS HAVING CANNIBAL FEMALES REGARDLESS TO THEIR PARTNERS, WERE CANNIBALS OR NOT. FEMALES DISCRIMINATED THEIR FILIAL (OWN) EGG, OFTEN-ADDED NEW EGGS AROUND THEM, AND PREFERENTIALLY CONSUMED NON-FILIAL EGGS. MATED FEMALE APPEARED TO CANNIBALIZE OTHER FEMALES EGGS TO MINIMIZE RISKS FOR ITS FILIAL EGGS, INCREASING THE EGG LAID FOLLOWING THAT CANNIBALIZED. EGG CANNIBALISM BY ADULTS DECLINED AFTER MATING IN FEMALES AND MALES, BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT CONSUMPTION FOR VIRGIN MALES. THIS PROBABLY EXPLAINS THE ACCELERATED DEVELOPMENT IN TREATMENTS HAD PATERNAL CANNIBALS. REPRODUCTIVE FEMALES CANNIBALIZED MORE EGGS THAN MALES, LIKELY TO OBTAIN NUTRITIONAL BENEFITS, WHEREAS NO DIFFERENCES OBTAINED BETWEEN VIRGIN FEMALES AND MALES.

PSYCHIATRY","RECENT STUDIES HAVE SUGGESTED THAT PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL TRAITS MAY BE TRANSGENERATIONALLY INHERITED THROUGH THE PATERNAL LINEAGE, POSSIBLY VIA NON-GENOMIC SIGNALS DERIVED FROM THE SPERM. TO INVESTIGATE HOW PATERNAL STRESS MIGHT INFLUENCE OFFSPRING BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPES, A MODEL OF HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS DYSREGULATION WAS USED. MALE BREEDERS WERE ADMINISTERED WATER SUPPLEMENTED WITH CORTICOSTERONE (CORT) FOR 4 WEEKS BEFORE MATING WITH UNTREATED FEMALE MICE. FEMALE, BUT NOT MALE, F1 OFFSPRING OF CORT-TREATED FATHERS DISPLAYED ALTERED FEAR EXTINCTION AT 2 WEEKS OF AGE. ONLY MALE F1 OFFSPRING EXHIBITED ALTERED PATTERNS OF ULTRASONIC VOCALIZATION AT POSTNATAL DAY 3 AND, AS ADULTS, SHOWED DECREASED TIME IN OPEN ON THE ELEVATED-PLUS MAZE AND TIME IN LIGHT ON THE LIGHT-DARK APPARATUS, SUGGESTING A HYPERANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORAL PHENOTYPE DUE TO PATERNAL CORT TREATMENT. INTERESTINGLY, EXPRESSION OF THE PATERNALLY IMPRINTED GENE IGF2 WAS INCREASED IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF F1 MALE OFFSPRING BUT DOWNREGULATED IN FEMALE OFFSPRING. MALE AND FEMALE F2 OFFSPRING DISPLAYED INCREASED TIME SPENT IN THE OPEN ARM OF THE ELEVATED-PLUS MAZE, SUGGESTING LOWER LEVELS OF ANXIETY COMPARED WITH CONTROL ANIMALS. ONLY MALE F2 OFFSPRING SHOWED INCREASED IMMOBILITY TIME ON THE FORCED-SWIM TEST AND INCREASED LATENCY TO FEED ON THE NOVELTY-SUPRESSED FEEDING TEST, SUGGESTING A DEPRESSION-LIKE PHENOTYPE IN THESE ANIMALS. COLLECTIVELY, THESE DATA PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL CORT TREATMENT ALTERS ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION-RELATED BEHAVIORS ACROSS MULTIPLE GENERATIONS. ANALYSIS OF THE SMALL RNA PROFILE IN SPERM FROM CORT-TREATED MALES REVEALED MARKED EFFECTS ON THE EXPRESSION OF SMALL NONCODING RNAS. SPERM FROM CORT-TREATED MALES CONTAINED ELEVATED LEVELS OF THREE MICRORNAS, MIR-98, MIR-144 AND MIR-190B, WHICH ARE PREDICTED TO INTERACT WITH MULTIPLE GROWTH FACTORS, INCLUDING IGF2 AND BDNF. SUSTAINED ELEVATION OF GLUCOCORTICOIDS IS THEREFORE INVOLVED IN THE TRANSMISSION OF PATERNAL STRESS-INDUCED TRAITS ACROSS GENERATIONS IN A PROCESS INVOLVING SMALL NONCODING RNA SIGNALS TRANSMITTED BY THE MALE GERMLINE.

THE MALES WERE DIVIDED INTO 3 GROUPS: G1 (UNTREATED GROUP), G2 (TREATED DAILY WITH 50 G/KG BW LEAD ACETATE), AND G3 (TREATED DAILY WITH 100 G/KG BW LEAD ACETATE). THE IMPLANTATION SUCCESS RATE, PREGNANCY OUTCOME, AND SEX RATIO WERE MEASURED. RESULTS: THE RESULTS SHOWED A HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BOTH THE PERCENTAGE OF IMPLANTATION RATE AND THE NUMBER OF OFFSPRING IN THE G3 MICE, BUT THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICATION DIFFERENCE FOR THE G2 MICE. THERE WAS A SLIGHT INSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF NEWBORN MALES COMPARED WITH FEMALES FOR BOTH G2 AND G3 MICE. CONCLUSION: THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST LEAD EXPOSURE IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS REDUCES IMPLANTATION RATE WITH PATERNAL BLL OF 28 G/DL AND THE SEX RATIO FOR OFFSPRING SHOWED A SLIGHT INSIGNIFICANT REDUCTION WITH BOTH PATERNAL BLLS OF 23.5 G/DL AND 28 G/DL.

PREGNANCY-RELATED OUTCOMES IN DASATINIB-TREATED PATIENTS OR THEIR PARTNERS REPORTED TO BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB FROM CLINICAL TRIALS OR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS THROUGH DECEMBER 2013 WERE REVIEWED. OUTCOMES WERE AVAILABLE IN 46/78 DASATINIB-TREATED WOMEN (59%) AND 33/69 PARTNERS OF DASATINIB-TREATED MEN (48%). FIFTEEN WOMEN (33%) DELIVERED A NORMAL INFANT; 18 (39%) AND 8 (17%) HAD AN ELECTIVE OR SPONTANEOUS ABORTION; AND 5 (11%) HAD AN ABNORMAL PREGNANCY. THERE WERE 7 REPORTS OF FETAL/INFANT ABNORMALITIES (ENCEPHALOCELE, RENAL TRACT ABNORMALITIES, AND HYDROPS FETALIS). THIRTY OF 33 (91%) INFANTS FATHERED BY DASATINIB-TREATED MEN WERE REPORTED NORMAL AT BIRTH. ALSO, ANIMAL STUDIES EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF DASATINIB ON FERTILITY, EMBRYO-FETAL TOXICITY, AND DEVELOPMENT, SUGGESTING THAT DASATINIB MAY BE A SELECTIVE DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICANT. THE OUTCOMES OF MOST PREGNANCIES CONCEIVED BY MEN TREATED WITH DASATINIB WERE NORMAL, BUT DUE TO THE SMALL NUMBER OF CASES, FURTHER MONITORING IS REQUIRED. SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON PREGNANCY OUTCOMES IN WOMEN TREATED WITH DASATINIB WERE FOUND, SUPPORTING CURRENT RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOMEN AVOID BECOMING PREGNANT DURING DASATINIB TREATMENT AND BE INFORMED OF FETAL RISKS. 2015 WILEY PERIODICALS, INC.",NA,"DASATINIB, 302962-49-8, 863127-77-9; HYDROXYUREA, 127-07-1; ANTINEOPLASTIC AGENTS; DASATINIB","AJHED","CORTES, J.E.; DEPARTMENT OF LEUKEMIA, MD ANDERSON CANCER CENTER, 1515 HOLCOMBE BLVD., UNIT 0428, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: JCORTES@MDANDERSON.ORG","ARTICLE","10.1002/ajh.24186","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,NIH,P01CA049639 NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,NIH,P30CA016672","03618609","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF HEMATOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,33,"12",NA,"1111-1115","WILEY-LISS INC.","26348106","SCOPUS","THE IMPACT OF DASATINIB ON PREGNANCY OUTCOMES",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954220288&doi=10.1002%2fajh.24186&partnerID=40&md5=2cd1e5dce64ab3901add6ab301dc54d4","90",2015,"THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO THANK ALL PARTICIPATING STUDY SITES AND THE PATIENTS AND PHYSICIANS WHO REPORTED THE SPONTANEOUS CASES USED IN THIS BMS-SPONSORED ANALYSIS.

LETT.","EXPOSURE TO ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS IN UTERO APPEARS TO ALTER EPIGENETICS IN THE MALE GERM-LINE AND SUBSEQUENTLY PROMOTE ADULT-ONSET DISEASE IN SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS. FETAL EXPOSURE TO BISPHENOL A (BPA), A HIGHLY PREVALENT ENDOCRINE DISRUPTOR IN ENVIRONMENT, HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ALTER EPIGENETIC MODIFICATION AND RESULT IN GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE IN ADULTHOOD. HOWEVER, WHETHER FETAL EXPOSURE TO BPA CAN INDUCE EPIGENETIC MODIFICATION AND PHENOTYPIC CHANGES IN THEIR SUBSEQUENT OFFSPRING ARE STILL UNCLEAR. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DESIGNED TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER EXPOSURE TO BPA IN EARLY LIFE INDUCED GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE IN THE OFFSPRING THROUGH MALE GERM LINE, AND THE UNDERLYING EPIGENETIC MOLECULAR BASIS. F0 PREGNANT SD RATS WERE RECEIVED CORN OIL OR 40. G/KG/DAY OF BPA DURING GESTATION AND LACTATION. F1 MALE RATS WERE MAINTAINED TO GENERATE F2 OFFSPRING BY MATING WITH UNTREATED FEMALE RATS. BOTH THE F1 RATS AFTER WEANING AND THE F2 OFFSPRING WERE NOT RECEIVED ANY OTHER TREATMENTS. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT MALE F2 OFFSPRING IN THE BPA GROUP EXHIBITED GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE AND -CELL DYSFUNCTION. DECREASED EXPRESSION OF IGF2 AND ASSOCIATED HYPERMETHYLATION OF IGF2 WERE OBSERVED IN ISLETS OF MALE F2 OFFSPRING. IN ADDITION, SIMILAR EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED IN FEMALE F2 ANIMALS, BUT THE EFFECTS WERE MORE PRONOUNCED IN MALES. MOREOVER, ABNORMAL EXPRESSION AND METHYLATION OF IGF2 WAS OBSERVED IN SPERM OF ADULT F1 MALE RATS, INDICATING THAT EPIGENETIC MODIFICATION IN GERM CELLS CAN BE PARTLY PROGRESSED TO THE NEXT GENERATION. OVERALL, OUR STUDY SUGGESTS THAT BPA EXPOSURE DURING EARLY LIFE CAN RESULT IN GENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF GLUCOSE INTOLERANCE AND -CELL DYSFUNCTION IN THE OFFSPRING THROUGH MALE GERM LINE, WHICH IS ASSOCIATED WITH HYPERMETHYLATION OF IGF2 IN ISLETS. THE CHANGES OF EPIGENETICS IN GERM CELLS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THIS GENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION. 2015 ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD.",NA,"4,4' ISOPROPYLIDENEDIPHENOL, 80-05-7; CORN OIL, 8001-30-7; GLUCOSE, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; INSULIN, 9004-10-8; SOMATOMEDIN B, 63774-77-6, 67763-97-7; DNA, 9007-49-2; AIR POLLUTANTS, OCCUPATIONAL; BENZHYDRYL COMPOUNDS; BISPHENOL A; BLOOD GLUCOSE; DNA; INSULIN; INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR II; INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR II, RAT; PHENOLS","TOLED","LI, Y.; SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, TONGJI MEDICAL COLLEGE, HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYCHINA","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.toxlet.2015.08.009","201309048 NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM)NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM),2012CB722401 20120142120017 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA,21437002,81402649,81372959","03784274","TOXICOLOGY LETTERS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,23,"3",NA,"30-38","ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD","26276081","SCOPUS","PATERNAL BPA EXPOSURE IN EARLY LIFE ALTERS IGF2 EPIGENETIC STATUS IN SPERM AND INDUCES PANCREATIC IMPAIRMENT IN RAT OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84940062417&doi=10.1016%2fj.toxlet.2015.08.009&partnerID=40&md5=2d238e241aaab637928ff1ac1941a654","238",2015,"THIS WORK WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM) ( 2012CB722401 ), THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA ( 21437002 , 81372959 , 81402649 ), THE R&D SPECIAL FUND FOR PUBLIC WELFARE INDUSTRY (ENVIRONMENT) ( 201309048 ), AND THE DOCTORAL FUND OF MINISTRY OF EDUCATION OF CHINA ( 20120142120017 ).

METHYLATION ALTERATIONS IN IMPRINTED GENES MAY BE RELATED TO WELL-DOCUMENTED TERATOGENIC EFFECTS OF ETHANOL. HERE WE SHOW THAT CHRONIC PATERNAL ETHANOL EXPOSURE INCREASES THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO ABNORMAL BEHAVIOR IN OFFSPRING THROUGH MALE GAME EPIGENETIC ALTERATION. IN OUR STUDY, DIFFERENT DOSES OF ETHANOL (0, 1.1, 3.3 G KG -1 ) WERE ADMINISTERED INTRA-GASTRICALLY TO MALE MICE AND DECREASED SPERM MOTILITY WAS FOUND IN THE HIGHEST ETHANOL-EXPOSED GROUP COMPARED WITH THE CONTROLS. DATA ALSO SHOWED A DOSE-DEPENDENT INCREASE IN DEAF MICE OF THE PATERNALLY ETHANOL-EXPOSED GROUPS. THE METHYLATION OF H19, PEG3, NDN AND SNRPN WAS ASSESSED IN PATERNAL SPERMATOZOA AND IN THE CEREBRAL CORTICES OF DEAF MICE. ETOH AFFECTED METHYLATION OF PEG3 (CPG 3, 7 AND 9) IN PATERNAL SPERMATOZOA AND IN THE CEREBRAL CORTICES OF DEAF MICE, BUT THE LEVEL OF MRNA EXPRESSION DID NOT CHANGE, SUGGESTING THAT OTHER GENE REGULATION MAY BE INVOLVED IN THESE PROCESSES. OVERALL, CHRONIC PATERNAL ETHANOL EXPOSURE COULD ALTER THE METHYLATION OF IMPRINTED GENES IN SIRE SPERMATOZOA THAT COULD ALSO BE PASSED ON TO OFFSPRING, GIVING RISE TO DEVELOPMENTAL DISORDERS.

CYTOBIOL.","INTRODUCTION. THE HORMONE-DEPENDENT EVENTS THAT OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE FIRST WAVE OF SPERMATOGENESIS, SUCH AS THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE NUMBER OF SERTOLI CELLS (SCS) AND SPERMATOGONIAL STEM CELLS (SSCS) WITHIN THE SEMINIFEROUS CORDS AND THE SETTING UP OF THE BLOOD-TESTIS BARRIER, ARE IMPORTANT FOR ADULT MALE FERTILITY. ANY CHANGES IN THE T/DHT RATIO CAN RESULT IN MALE SUBFERTILITY OR EVEN INFERTILITY. IN THIS STUDY WE AIMED TO EVALUATE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO 5-ALPHA REDUCTASE TYPE 2 INHIBITOR, FINASTERIDE ON LITTER SIZE, ANDROGEN LEVELS AND GERM CELL APOPTOSIS IN MALE OFFSPRING DURING POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT. MATERIAL AND METHODS. THE SUBJECTS OF THE STUDY WERE 7, 14, 21/22, 28, AND 90-DAY-OLD WISTAR MALE RATS (F1:FIN) BORN FROM FEMALES FERTILIZED BY FINASTERIDE-TREATED RATS. OFFSPRING BORN FROM UNTREATED PARENTAL ANIMALS WERE USED AS A CONTROL GROUP (F1:CONTROL). ANIMALS AND THE COLLECTED TESTES WERE WEIGHED, BLOOD AND INTRATESTICULAR LEVELS OF T AND DHT WERE MEASURED BY ELISA, AND THE APOPTOTIC INDEX OF TESTICULAR CELLS WAS EVALUATED BY TUNEL TECHNIQUE. RESULTS. WE OBSERVED DIFFICULTIES IN OBTAINING MALE NEWBORNS FROM FEMALE RATS FERTILIZED BY FINASTERIDE-TREATED MALE RATS. IN THE F1:FIN RATS, CHANGES IN THE BODY AND TESTES WEIGHTS OCCURRED, AND A LOWER NUMBER OF APOPTOTIC CELLS WAS FOUND DURING POSTNATAL MATURATION OF THE SEMINIFEROUS EPITHELIUM. CHANGES IN ANDROGEN CONCENTRATIONS DURING THE FIRST SPERMATOGENESIS WAVE AND ADULT LIFE WERE ALSO EVIDENT. CONCLUSION. FINASTERIDE TREATMENT OF MALE ADULT RATS MAY NOT ONLY CAUSE A DECREASE IN THE FERTILITY OF PARENTAL RATS, BUT ALSO COULD LEAD TO INCORRECT, ANDROGEN-SENSITIVE COURSE OF SPERMATOGENESIS IN THEIR OFFSPRING. 2015, POLISH SOCIETY FOR HISTOCHEMISTRY AND CYTOCHEMISTRY.",NA,"ANDROSTANOLONE, 521-18-6; FINASTERIDE, 98319-26-7; TESTOSTERONE, 58-22-0; ANDROGENS; FINASTERIDE","FHCYE","KOLASA-WOLOSIUK, A.; DEPARTMENT OF HISTOLOGY AND EMBRYOLOGY, POMERANIAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, POWSTANCOW WIELKOPOLSKICH 72, POLAND; EMAIL: AGNIESZKA.KOLASA@PUM.EDU.PL","ARTICLE","10.5603/FHC.a2015.0025",NA,"02398508","FOLIA HISTOCHEMICA ET CYTOBIOLOGICA","ENGLISH","MERCK SHARP AND DOHME, UNITED KINGDOM",NA,7,"3",NA,"236-248","VIA MEDICA","26377331","SCOPUS","ANDROGEN LEVELS AND APOPTOSIS IN THE TESTIS DURING POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT OF FINASTERIDE-TREATED MALE RAT OFFSPRING","PROSCAR, MERCK SHARP AND DOHME, UNITED KINGDOM","https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943641128&doi=10.5603%2fFHC.a2015.0025&partnerID=40&md5=019e61e76c5f80ae4bd286c778beaa24","53",2015,"NA NA NA","POMERANIAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;POMERANIAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;POMERANIAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;POMERANIAN MEDICAL UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"KOLASA-WOLOSIUK A, 2015, FOLIA HISTOCHEM CYTOBIOL","KOLASA-WOLOSIUK A, 2015, FOLIA HISTOCHEM CYTOBIOL"

WHILE THE EFFECTS OF EITHER PATERNAL OR MATERNAL OBESITY ON GAMETE HEALTH AND SUBSEQUENT FERTILITY AND PREGNANCY HAVE BEEN REPORTED INDEPENDENTLY, THE COMBINATION OF HAVING BOTH PARENTS OVERWEIGHT/ OBESE ON FECUNDITY AND OFFSPRING HEALTH HAS RECEIVED MINIMAL ATTENTION. USING A 2 2 STUDY DESIGN IN RODENTS WE ESTABLISHED THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTIONS OF PATERNAL AND MATERNAL OBESITY ON FETAL AND EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT AND WHETHER COMBINED PATERNAL AND MATERNAL OBESITY HAD AN ADDITIVE EFFECT. HERE, WE SHOW THAT PARENTAL OBESITY REDUCES FETAL AND PLACENTAL WEIGHTS WITHOUT ALTERING PREGNANCY ESTABLISHMENT AND IS NOT DEPENDENT ON AN IN UTERO EXPOSURE TO A HIGH-FAT DIET. INTERESTINGLY COMBINED PARENTAL OBESITY SEEMED TO ACCUMULATE BOTH THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCES OF PATERNAL AND MATERNAL OBESITY HAD ALONE ON EMBRYO AND FETAL HEALTH RATHER THAN AN AMPLIFICATION, MANIFESTED AS REDUCED EMBRYO DEVELOPMENTAL COMPETENCY, REDUCED BLASTOCYST CELL NUMBERS, IMPAIRED MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION, AND ALTERATIONS TO ACTIVE AND REPRESSIVE EMBRYONIC CHROMATIN MARKS, RESULTING IN ABERRANT PLACENTAL GENE EXPRESSION AND REDUCED FETAL LIVER MTDNA COPY NUMBERS. FURTHER UNDERSTANDING BOTH THE MATERNAL CYTOPLASMIC AND PATERNAL GENETIC INTERACTIONS DURING THIS EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL TIME FRAME WILL BE VITAL FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMMING IS REGULATED AND FOR THE PROPOSITION OF INTERVENTIONS TO MITIGATE THEIR EFFECTS. 2015 THE AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY.",NA,NA,"AJPMD","MCPHERSON, N.O.; UNIV OF ADELAIDE, SCHOOL OF PEDIATRICS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, DISCIPLINE OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY, LEVEL 3 MEDICAL SCHOOL SOUTHAUSTRALIA","ARTICLE","10.1152/ajpendo.00230.2015",NA,"01931849","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY - ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM","ENGLISH",NA,NA,25,"6",NA,"E568-E581","AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY","26199280","SCOPUS","WHEN TWO OBESE PARENTS ARE WORSE THAN ONE!

HOWEVER, HUMAN EVIDENCE FOR MULTIGENERATIONAL EFFECTS IS LACKING. WE EXAMINED WHETHER PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO THE CHINESE FAMINE OF 1959-61 AFFECTS ADULT COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN TWO CONSECUTIVE GENERATIONS. IN THIS RETROSPECTIVE FAMILY COHORT STUDY, WE INVESTIGATED 1062 FAMILIES CONSISTING OF 2124 PARENTS AND 1215 OFFSPRING. WE ASSESSED PARENTAL AND OFFSPRING COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE BY MEANS OF A COMPREHENSIVE TEST BATTERY. GENERALIZED LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL ANALYSIS IN THE PARENTAL GENERATION SHOWED THAT PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO FAMINE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A 8.1 (95% CI 5.8 TO 10.4) SECOND INCREASE IN TRAIL MAKING TEST PART A, A 7.0 (1.5 TO 12.5) SECOND INCREASE IN TRAIL MAKING TEST PART B, AND A 5.5 (-7.3 TO-3.7) SCORE DECREASE IN THE STROOP COLOR-WORD TEST IN ADULTHOOD, AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS. IN THE OFFSPRING GENERATION, LINEAR MIXED MODEL ANALYSIS FOUND NO SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PARENTAL PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO FAMINE AND OFFSPRING COGNITIVE FUNCTION IN ADULTHOOD AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS. IN CONCLUSION, PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO SEVERE MALNUTRITION IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH VISUAL-MOTOR SKILL, MENTAL FLEXIBILITY, AND SELECTIVE ATTENTION IN ADULTHOOD.

PRENATAL (GESTATIONAL) STRESS HAS BEEN SHOWN TO ALTER BRAIN MORPHOLOGY IN THE DEVELOPING BRAIN, AND IS PRESUMED TO BE A FACTOR IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME ADULT PSYCHOPATHOLOGIES. OUR HYPOTHESIS WAS THAT PATERNAL STRESS IN THE PRECONCEPTION PERIOD COULD IMPACT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT IN THE OFFSPRING, LEADING TO BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES LATER IN LIFE. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL STRESS ON DEVELOPING MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING BRAIN MORPHOLOGY IN FIVE BRAIN AREAS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (MPFC), ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX (OFC), PARIETAL CORTEX (PAR1), HIPPOCAMPUS (CA1) AND NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS (NAC). ALTERATIONS IN DENDRITIC MEASURES AND SPINE DENSITY WERE OBSERVED IN EACH BRAIN AREA EXAMINED IN PATERNAL STRESS OFFSPRING. OUR TWO MAIN FINDINGS REVEAL; (1) PPS ALTERS BRAIN MORPHOLOGY AND ORGANIZATION AND THESE EFFECTS ARE DIFFERENT THAN THE EFFECTS OF STRESS OBSERVED AT OTHER AGES; AND, (2) THE OBSERVED DENDRITIC CHANGES WERE SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC. THIS STUDY PROVIDES DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT PPS MODIFIES BRAIN ARCHITECTURE IN DEVELOPING OFFSPRING, INCLUDING DENDRITIC LENGTH, CELL COMPLEXITY, AND SPINE DENSITY.

ZOOL.","BACKGROUND: EARLY EXPERIENCES INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPING ORGANISM, WITH LIFELONG AND POTENTIALLY ADAPTIVE CONSEQUENCES. IT HAS RECENTLY BECOME CLEAR THAT THE EFFECTS OF EARLY EXPERIENCES ARE NOT LIMITED TO THE EXPOSED GENERATION, BUT CAN INFLUENCE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL TRAITS IN THE NEXT GENERATION. MECHANISMS OF TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF PARENTAL EARLY EXPERIENCES ON OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT ARE OFTEN ATTRIBUTED TO PRENATAL OR POSTNATAL PARENTAL INFLUENCE, BUT RECENT DATA SUGGEST THAT GERM-LINE PLASTICITY MAY ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN THE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF EARLY EXPERIENCES. THESE NON-GENETIC TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS ARE A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENTAL AND EVOLUTIONARY FORCE, BUT THE EFFECTS OF PARENTAL EXPERIENCES ON BEHAVIOR AND PHYSIOLOGY ARE NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD IN SOCIALLY COMPLEX PRIMATES. IN THE NON-HUMAN PRIMATE, THE RHESUS MACAQUE, NURSERY REARING (NR) IS AN EARLY LIFE MANIPULATION USED FOR COLONY MANAGEMENT PURPOSES, AND INVOLVES SEPARATING INFANTS FROM PARENTS EARLY IN LIFE. WE EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EARLY NR ON INFANT RHESUS MACAQUE IMMUNITY, PHYSIOLOGY, AND BEHAVIOR. RESULTS: WE THEORIZED THAT DIFFERENCES IN BEHAVIOR OR PHYSIOLOGY IN THE ABSENCE OF PARENT-OFFSPRING SOCIAL CONTACT WOULD POINT TO BIOLOGICAL AND PERHAPS GERM-LINE, RATHER THAN SOCIAL, MECHANISMS OF EFFECT. THUS, ALL SUBJECTS WERE THEMSELVES NR. MALE AND FEMALE INFANT RHESUS MACAQUES (N= 206) WERE SEPARATED FROM PARENTS AND SOCIAL GROUPS IN THE FIRST FOUR DAYS OF LIFE TO UNDERGO NR. THESE INFANTS DIFFERED ONLY IN THEIR DEGREE OF NR ANCESTRY - WHETHER THEIR DAMS OR SIRES WERE THEMSELVES NR. AT 3-4 MONTHS OF AGE, INFANTS UNDERWENT A STANDARDIZED BIOBEHAVIORAL ASSESSMENT. FACTORS DESCRIBING IMMUNITY, PLASMA CORTISOL, AND EMOTION REGULATION WERE GENERATED FROM THESE DATA USING FACTOR ANALYSIS. PATERNAL, BUT NOT MATERNAL, NR WAS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER EMOTIONALITY AND HIGHER PLASMA CORTISOL, COMPARED WITH INFANTS BORN TO CONTROL REARED FATHERS. CONCLUSIONS: THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT MACAQUE BIOBEHAVIORAL MAKEUP IS STRONGLY INFLUENCED BY PATERNAL EXPERIENCES, AND VIA NON-SOCIAL MECHANISMS. 2015 KINNALLY ET AL.","S14",NA,NA,"KINNALLY, E.L.; UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS, CALIFORNIA NATIONAL PRIMATE RESEARCH CENTERUNITED STATES; EMAIL: ELKINNALLY@UCDAVIS.EDU","REVIEW","10.1186/1742-9994-12-S1-S14",NA,"17429994","FRONTIERS IN ZOOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,11,"1",NA,NA,"BIOMED CENTRAL LTD.",NA,"SCOPUS","PATERNAL EARLY EXPERIENCES INFLUENCE INFANT DEVELOPMENT THROUGH NON-SOCIAL MECHANISMS IN RHESUS MACAQUES",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84977581917&doi=10.1186%2f1742-9994-12-S1-S14&partnerID=40&md5=c283301f17a692a2368515d1f1b81438","12",2015,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS;NOTREPORTED",NA,"KINNALLY EL, 2015, FRONT ZOOL","KINNALLY EL, 2015, FRONT ZOOL"

SUCH EARLY STRESS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE PROGENY EVEN IF NOT DIRECTLY EXPOSED, LIKELY THROUGH EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS. HERE, WE REPORT IN MICE THAT THE OFFSPRING OF MALES SUBJECTED TO POSTNATAL TRAUMATIC STRESS HAVE DECREASED GENE EXPRESSION IN MOLECULAR PATHWAYS NECESSARY FOR NEURONAL SIGNALING, AND ALTERED SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY WHEN ADULT. LONG-TERM POTENTIATION IS ABOLISHED AND LONG-TERM DEPRESSION IS ENHANCED IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS, AND THESE DEFECTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPAIRED LONG-TERM MEMORY IN BOTH THE EXPOSED FATHERS AND THEIR OFFSPRING. THE BRAIN-SPECIFIC GAMMA ISOFORM OF PROTEIN KINASE C (PRKCC) IS ONE OF THE AFFECTED SIGNALING COMPONENTS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS. ITS EXPRESSION IS REDUCED IN THE OFFSPRING, AND DNA METHYLATION AT ITS PROMOTER IS ALTERED BOTH IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF THE OFFSPRING AND THE SPERM OF FATHERS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT POSTNATAL TRAUMATIC STRESS IN MALES CAN AFFECT BRAIN PLASTICITY AND COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS IN THE ADULT PROGENY, POSSIBLY THROUGH EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS IN THE MALE GERMLINE. 2015 MACMILLAN PUBLISHERS LIMITED.",NA,"PROTEIN KINASE C, 141436-78-4; PROTEIN KINASE C; PROTEIN KINASE C GAMMA","MOPSF","MANSUY, I.M.; BRAIN RESEARCH INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF ZURICH, SWISS FEDERAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, WINTERTHURERSTRASSE 190, SWITZERLAND","ARTICLE","10.1038/mp.2014.80","SCHWEIZERISCHER NATIONALFONDS ZUR FRDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN FORSCHUNGSCHWEIZERISCHER NATIONALFONDS ZUR FRDERUNG DER WISSENSCHAFTLICHEN FORSCHUNG BROWN FOUNDATION INSTITUTE OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF HUMAN DISEASESBROWN FOUNDATION INSTITUTE OF MOLECULAR MEDICINE FOR THE PREVENTION OF HUMAN DISEASES ROCHEROCHE","13594184","MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,43,"5",NA,"621-631","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","25092246","SCOPUS","PATHOLOGICAL BRAIN PLASTICITY AND COGNITION IN THE OFFSPRING OF MALES SUBJECTED TO POSTNATAL TRAUMATIC STRESS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84929131136&doi=10.1038%2fmp.2014.80&partnerID=40&md5=e5411213949b1d5b61a302070f043950","20",2015,"WE THANK CARL KASHUK FOR HELP WITH MICROARRAY DATA PROCESSING, HEIDI ROSENBAUM FOR HELP IN MICROARRAY DATA ACQUISITION, BECHARA SAAB FOR TECHNICAL HELP, AND HEIKO HRSTER, GISEP BAZZELL AND YVONNE ZIPFEL FOR ANIMAL CARE.

THIS EXPERIMENT WAS PERFORMED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT OF MTBE ON OFFSPRING SEX RATIO, SEX HORMONES AND ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES. A TOTAL OF 20 ADULT SPRAGUE-DAWLEY MALE RATS WERE DIVIDED INTO FOUR GROUPS AND RECEIVED 0, 400, 800 AND 1600 MG/KG/DAY MTBE BY GAVAGES FOR 30 CONSECUTIVE DAYS. AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT, BLOOD SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FOR DETERMINATION OF SEX HORMONES AND ANTIOXIDANT ENZYMES. THEN, MALE RATS WERE MATED WITH HEALTHY UNEXPOSED FEMALE RATS AND SEX OF OFFSPRING WAS DETERMINED AFTER BIRTH. SEX RATIO WAS 0.48, 0.50, 0.43 AND 0.50 IN 0, 400, 800 AND 1600 MG/KG/DAY MTBE GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY (P = 0.91). THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT DECREASING TREND FOR LUTEINIZING HORMONE (LH) AND TESTOSTERONE IN EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS (RS = 0.50, P = 0.030 AND RS = 0.67, P = 0.002, RESPECTIVELY). NO CHANGES WERE OBSERVED FOR SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE. HOWEVER, DECREASE IN GLUTATHIONE PEROXIDASE (GPX) WAS OBSERVED IN ALL TREATMENT GROUPS COMPARED WITH CONTROL WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANT IN 400 MG/KG/DAY MTBE GROUP (P = 0.016). THE PRESENT STUDY SHOWED THAT PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO ORAL MTBE HAS NO EFFECT ON OFFSPRING SEX RATIO; WHILE, MTBE EXPOSURE COULD EXERT DOSE-DEPENDENT CHANGES IN SERUM TESTOSTERONE AND LH IN TREATMENT GROUPS.

HOWEVER, THE MOLECULAR PATHWAYS INVOLVED IN THESE CHANGES REMAIN UNCLEAR. USING A HIGH FAT DIET (HFD)-INDUCED OBESITY MOUSE MODEL, WE EXAMINED LIVER GENE EXPRESSION IN MALE OFFSPRING AND ANALYZED CHROMATIN OF PATERNAL SPERMATOZOA. WE FOUND THAT THE HEPATIC MRNA LEVEL OF 7 GENES (OUT OF 20 EVALUATED) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERED IN HFD MALE OFFSPRING COMPARED TO CONTROL MICE, SUGGESTING THAT PHENOTYPIC CHANGES IN THE OFFSPRING DEPEND ON PARENTAL DIET. WE EXAMINED 7 IMPRINTED LOCI IN SPERMATOZOA DNA FROM HFD-TREATED AND CONTROL FATHERS BY BISULFITE SEQUENCING, BUT DID NOT DETECT CHANGES IN DNA METHYLATION ASSOCIATED WITH HFD. USING CHROMATIN IMMUNOPRECIPITATION FOLLOWED BY HIGH-THROUGHPUT SEQUENCING, WE FOUND DIFFERENTIAL HISTONE H3-OCCUPANCY AT GENES INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION OF EMBRYOGENESIS AND DIFFERENTIAL H3K4ME1-ENRICHMENT AT TRANSCRIPTION REGULATORY GENES IN HFD FATHERS VS. CONTROL MICE. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT DIETARY EXPOSURE CAN MODULATE HISTONE COMPOSITION AT REGULATORY GENES IMPLICATED IN DEVELOPMENTAL PROCESSES. 2015 TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP, LLC.",NA,"HISTONE, 9062-68-4; HISTONES",NA,"MUEGGE, K.; CENTER FOR CANCER RESEARCH, NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTEUNITED STATES; EMAIL: KATHRIN.MUEGGE@NIH","ARTICLE","10.1080/15592294.2015.1075691","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,HHSN26120080001E NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTENATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH U.S. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINEU.S. NATIONAL LIBRARY OF MEDICINE","15592294","EPIGENETICS","ENGLISH",NA,"GENBANK: GSE29184",36,"9",NA,"161-171","TAYLOR AND FRANCIS INC.","26252449","SCOPUS","EFFECT OF HIGH FAT DIET ON PATERNAL SPERM HISTONE DISTRIBUTION AND MALE OFFSPRING LIVER GENE EXPRESSION",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84954553347&doi=10.1080%2f15592294.2015.1075691&partnerID=40&md5=00eefbde35c3bb19128513fc218d2423","10",2015,"THIS PROJECT HAS BEEN FUNDED IN WHOLE OR IN PART WITH FEDERAL FUNDS FROM THE NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE, NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH, UNDER CONTRACT HHSN26120080001E.

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL CD EXPOSURE ON THE SPERM QUALITY OF MALE RATS AND THE NEUROBEHAVIORAL SYSTEM OF THEIR OFFSPRING. A TOTAL OF 12 MALE RATS WERE RANDOMIZED INTO A CONTROL AND CD-TREATED GROUP (N=6 PER GROUP), AND 12 FEMALE RATS WERE ADMINISTERED DISTILLED WATER AND RANDOMLY DIVIDED INTO TWO GROUPS (N=6 PER GROUP). SUBSEQUENTLY, SPERM MOTILITY, VIABILITY, MALFORMATION RATE OF MALE RATS AND THE NEUROMOTOR MATURATION, ANTIOXIDANT ABILITY, CD ACCUMULATION IN DIFFERENT ORGANS OF THEIR OFFSPRING WERE MEASURED. COMPARED WITH THE CONTROL RATS, THE SPERM MOTILITY RATE AND VITALITY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED (P<0.01) AND THE SPERM MALFORMATION RATE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED (P<0.01) IN THE MALE RATS FOLLOWING CD TREATMENT. REGARDING THE NERVOUS SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFSPRING, THE CLIFF-AVOIDANCE REFLEX, SURFACE-RIGHTING REFLEX AND NEGATIVE GEOTAXIS RESULTS EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CD EXPOSURE AND CONTROL GROUPS (P<0.05). THE CD CONTENT IN THE LIVER AND HEART OF THE OFFSPRING OF THE CD EXPOSURE RATS WAS HIGHER THAN THAT IN THE CONTROL RATS (P<0.05), AND THE LIVER CONTENT PEAKED ON POSTNATAL DAY 21. FURTHERMORE, CD EXPOSURE AFFECTED THE ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY OF THE OFFSPRING, WHICH WAS SHOWN BY GLUTATHIONE, MALONDIALDEHYDE AND SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE ASSAYS. COLLECTIVELY, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT CD EXPOSURE AFFECTS THE SPERM QUALITY OF MALE RATS AND THE NEUROBEHAVIORAL SYSTEM OF THEIR OFFSPRING. 2015, SPANDIDOS PUBLICATIONS.

IN MICE PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO A HIGH FAT DIET (HFD) IMPAIRS THE METABOLIC AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OF MALE OFFSPRING, DESPITE THEIR CONTROL DIET (CD) CONSUMPTION. HOWEVER, OFFSPRING SHARE LIFESTYLE, INCLUDING DIET, WITH PARENTS. WE ASSESSED IF MALE OFFSPRING FROM HFD FATHERS HAVE A HEIGHTENED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO HFD-INDUCED METABOLIC AND REPRODUCTIVE DERANGEMENTS. THIS 2 9 2 DESIGN SAW FOUNDER MALES (F0) AND THEIR OFFSPRING (F1) FED EITHER A HFD OR A NUTRITIONALLY MATCHED CD. REGARDLESS OF PATERNAL DIET, HFD FED MALE OFFSPRING HAD GREATER TOTAL BODY WEIGHT AND ADIPOSITY. OFFSPRING SIRED BY A HFD MALE AND FED A HFD WERE THE HEAVIEST, HAD THE GREATEST ADIPOSITY AND HAD THE GREATEST CONCENTRATION OF SERUM CHOLESTEROL, TRIGLYCERIDE, HDL, AND NEFA COMPARED WITH CD SIRED/FED LITTERMATES. A SYNERGISTIC INCREASE IN SERUM INSULIN WAS UNMASKED BY BOTH FATHER/SON HFD CONSUMPTION, CONCOMITANT WITH INCREASED SERA GLUCOSE. EITHER A PATERNAL OR OFFSPRING HFD WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SIMILAR REDUCTIONS TO OFFSPRING SPERM MOTILITY. WHEREAS SPERM ROS CONCENTRATIONS AND SPERMOOCYTE BINDING SAW DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF BOTH F0 HFD AND F1 HFD WITH AN INTERACTION EVIDENT BETWEEN BOTH, CULMINATING IN THE MOST IMPAIRED SPERM PARAMETERS IN THIS GROUP. THIS INDICATES THAT METABOLIC AND FERTILITY DISTURBANCES IN MALE OFFSPRING SIRED BY HFD FATHERS ARE EXACERBATED BY A SECOND-HIT OF EXPOSURE TO THE SAME OBESOGENIC ENVIRONMENT POSTNATALLY. IF TRANSLATABLE TO HUMAN HEALTH, THIS SUGGESTS THAT ADVERSE REPRODUCTIVE AND METABOLIC OUTCOMES MAY BE AMPLIFIED ACROSS GENERATIONS THROUGH A SHARED CALORIE DENSE DIET, RELEVANT TO THE CURRENT WORLDWIDE OBESITY EPIDEMIC. 2015 THE AUTHORS.","E12336","INSULIN, 9004-10-8; TESTOSTERONE, 58-22-0",NA,"FULLSTON, T.; LEVEL 3 MEDICAL SCHOOL SOUTH, UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDEAUSTRALIA; EMAIL: TOD.FULLSTON@ADELAIDE.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.14814/phy2.12336","AUSTRALIA COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS, AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENTAUSTRALIA COUNCIL FOR THE ARTS, AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCILNATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL","2051817X","PHYSIOLOGICAL REPORTS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,46,"3",NA,NA,"AMERICAN PHYSIOLOGICAL SOCIETY",NA,"SCOPUS","PATERNAL OBESITY INDUCES METABOLIC AND SPERM DISTURBANCES IN MALE OFFSPRING THAT ARE EXACERBATED BY THEIR EXPOSURE TO AN OBESOGENIC DIET",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84943650348&doi=10.14814%2fphy2.12336&partnerID=40&md5=fe1870389bd43d21ad35c85cc73f1ad2","3",2015,"THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED WAS FUNDED BY THE AWARD OF A PROJECT GRANT FROM THE NATIONAL HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (NHMRC) OF THE AUSTRALIA GOVERNMENT.

HERE, WE STUDIED THE INTRA- AND TRANS-GENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF LARVAL DIET ON SUSCEPTIBILITY TO AN ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGUS, BEAUVERIA BASSIANA, IN THE GREATER WAX MOTH, GALLERIA MELLONELLA. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE STUDY, A SPLIT-BROOD DESIGN WAS USED TO COMPARE THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF FULL SIBS RAISED EITHER ON LOW- OR ON HIGH-NUTRITION LARVAL DIET. IN THE SECOND PART OF THE STUDY, A SIMILAR EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN WAS EMPLOYED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL DIET AS WELL AS THEIR INTERACTION ON OFFSPRING'S SUSCEPTIBILITY. IN THE FIRST PART OF THE STUDY, WE FOUND THAT INDIVIDUALS FED WITH HIGH-NUTRITION DIET HAD HIGHER MORTALITY FROM INFECTION THAN INDIVIDUALS FED WITH LOW-NUTRITION DIET. HOWEVER, DIET DID NOT AFFECT POST-INFECTION SURVIVAL TIME. CONVERSELY, IN THE SECOND PART OF THE STUDY, MATERNAL DIET WAS FOUND TO HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON FINAL MORTALITY RATE OF OFFSPRING, BUT IT AFFECTED SURVIVAL TIME: LARVAE WITH HIGH-NUTRITION MATERNAL DIET SURVIVED FEWER DAYS AFTER INFECTION THAN LARVAE WITH LOW-NUTRITION MATERNAL DIET. PATERNAL DIET HAD NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON OFFSPRING'S SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE FUNGUS, INDICATING THAT PATERNAL EFFECTS ARE NOT AS IMPORTANT AS MATERNAL EFFECTS IN INFLUENCING IMMUNE FUNCTION IN THIS SPECIES. OUR FINDINGS PROVIDE FURTHER INDICATION THAT MATERNAL NUTRITION AFFECTS IMMUNE FUNCTION IN INSECTS, AND SUGGEST THAT THE DIRECT EFFECTS OF NUTRITION ON IMMUNITY MAY BE DIFFERENT, YET PARALLEL, TO THOSE CAUSED BY PARENTAL NUTRITION. 2015 EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY.",NA,NA,"JEBIE","KANGASSALO, K.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, SECTION OF ECOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF TURKUFINLAND","ARTICLE","10.1111/jeb.12666",NA,"1010061X","JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,10,"8",NA,"1453-1464","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","26052853","SCOPUS","INTRA- AND TRANS-GENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF LARVAL DIET ON SUSCEPTIBILITY TO AN ENTOMOPATHOGENIC FUNGUS, BEAUVERIA BASSIANA, IN THE GREATER WAX MOTH, GALLERIA MELLONELLA",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84938996962&doi=10.1111%2fjeb.12666&partnerID=40&md5=cb1a32e18b6922dbacdb2d28ceb2ee48","28",2015,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF TURKU;UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA;INSTITUTE OF ANIMAL SYSTEMATICS AND ECOLOGY;UNIVERSITY OF EASTERN FINLAND;UNIVERSITY OF TURKU","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF TURKUFINLAND",NA,"KANGASSALO K, 2015, J EVOL BIOL","KANGASSALO K, 2015, J EVOL BIOL"

THE BIOBEHAVIORAL CHARACTERIZATION OF ADULT OFFSPRING WAS DETECTED BY MORRIS WATER MAZE TEST, ELEVATED PLUS MAZE, AND FORCED SWIMMING TEST. WE REPORT THE PRESENCE OF A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE OF TIME SPENT IN OPEN ARMS (THE TIME SPENT IN THE OPEN ARMS/THE TIME SPENT IN THE OPEN ARMS + THE TIME SPENT IN THE CLOSED ARMS) AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ENTRY INTO OPEN ARMS (ENTRY INTO THE OPEN ARMS/ENTRY INTO THE OPEN ARMS + ENTRY INTO CLOSED ARMS) IN ELEVATED PLUS MAZE, AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE IMMOBILITY TIME IN FORCED SWIMMING TEST, FOLLOWING PATERNAL SLEEP DISTURBANCES.

ENTOMOL. RES.","WHEN HARMONIA AXYRIDIS LARVAE WERE SUBJECTED TO AMPUTATION OF A FORELEG IN THE FOURTH INSTAR, 83% SURVIVED AND, OF THESE, 75% REGENERATED THE LEG DURING PUPATION. REGENERATORS PUPATED AT HEAVIER WEIGHTS THAN CONTROLS (UNOPERATED) OR NON-REGENERATORS, AND SPENT LONGER IN PUPATION. REGENERATED MALES WERE PREFERRED BY FEMALES IN CHOICE TESTS AND PRODUCED MORE VIABLE PROGENY THAN CONTROL MALES. UNREGENERATED MALES WERE LESS PREFERRED BY FEMALES, COPULATED FOR SHORTER PERIODS THAN CONTROL MALES, AND REDUCED FEMALE FECUNDITY. AMPUTATION DIMINISHED BENEFICIAL PATERNAL EFFECTS, WHETHER MALES REGENERATED OR NOT, RESULTING IN PROGENY WITH SLOWER DEVELOPMENT AND SMALLER ADULT BODY MASS RELATIVE TO CONTROL PATERNITY. PROGENY OF UNREGENERATED MALES HAD LOWER SURVIVAL AND BODY MASS, WHETHER MALE OR FEMALE, CONFIRMING THAT REGENERATION WAS AN HONEST SIGNAL OF MATE QUALITY. WHEN OFFSPRING HAD A FORELEG AMPUTATED, A REGENERATED PATERNITY YIELDED HIGHER SURVIVAL THAN CONTROL PATERNITY, BUT SIMILAR RATES OF REGENERATION, WHEREAS AN UNREGENERATED PATERNITY YIELDED LOWER RATES OF SURVIVAL AND LEG REGENERATION THAN CONTROL PATERNITY. REGENERATING BEETLES WERE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE MELANIC AS NON-REGENERATING OR CONTROL BEETLES, SUGGESTING PLEIOTROPIC EFFECTS OF MELANISM ON PROCESSES INVOLVED IN REGENERATION.

J. OBES.","BACKGROUND:SEVERAL EPIDEMIOLOGIC STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PERICONCEPTIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES AND HEALTH STATUS OF THE OFFSPRING IN LATER LIFE. ALTHOUGH THESE ENVIRONMENTALLY RELATED EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO EPIGENETIC CHANGES, SUCH AS DNA METHYLATION SHIFTS AT IMPRINTED GENES, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PRECONCEPTIONAL OVERNUTRITION OR OBESITY.OBJECTIVE:WE EXAMINED PARENTAL PRECONCEPTIONAL OBESITY IN RELATION TO DNA METHYLATION PROFILES AT MULTIPLE HUMAN IMPRINTED GENES IMPORTANT IN NORMAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS: MATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENE 3 (MEG3), MESODERM-SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPT (MEST), PATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENE 3 (PEG3), PLEIOMORPHIC ADENOMA GENE-LIKE 1 (PLAGL1), EPSILON SARCOGLYCAN AND PATERNALLY EXPRESSED GENE 10 (SGCE/PEG10) AND NEURONATIN (NNAT).METHODS:WE MEASURED METHYLATION PERCENTAGES AT THE DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED REGIONS (DMRS) BY BISULFITE PYROSEQUENCING IN DNA EXTRACTED FROM UMBILICAL CORD BLOOD LEUKOCYTES OF 92 NEWBORNS. PRECONCEPTIONAL OBESITY, DEFINED AS BMI 30 KG M -2, WAS ASCERTAINED THROUGH STANDARDIZED QUESTIONNAIRES.RESULTS:AFTER ADJUSTING FOR POTENTIAL CONFOUNDERS AND CLUSTER EFFECTS, PATERNAL OBESITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER METHYLATION LEVELS AT THE MEST (=-2.57; S.E.=0.95; P=0.008), PEG3 (=-1.71; S.E.=0.61; P=0.005) AND NNAT (=-3.59; S.E.=1.76; P=0.04) DMRS. CHANGES RELATED TO MATERNAL OBESITY DETECTED AT OTHER LOCI WERE AS FOLLOWS: -COEFFICIENT WAS +2.58 (S.E.=1.00; P=0.01) AT THE PLAGL1 DMR AND -3.42 (S.E.=1.69; P=0.04) AT THE MEG3 DMR.CONCLUSION:WE FOUND ALTERED METHYLATION OUTCOMES AT MULTIPLE IMPRINT REGULATORY REGIONS IN CHILDREN BORN TO OBESE PARENTS, COMPARED WITH CHILDREN BORN TO NON-OBESE PARENTS. IN SPITE OF THE SMALL SAMPLE SIZE, OUR DATA SUGGEST A PRECONCEPTIONAL INFLUENCE OF PARENTAL LIFE-STYLE OR OVERNUTRITION ON THE (RE)PROGRAMMING OF IMPRINT MARKS DURING GAMETOGENESIS AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY, THE SIGNIFICANT AND INDEPENDENT ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATERNAL OBESITY AND THE OFFSPRING'S METHYLATION STATUS SUGGESTS THE SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE DEVELOPING SPERM FOR ENVIRONMENTAL INSULTS. THE ACQUIRED IMPRINT INSTABILITY MAY BE CARRIED ONTO THE NEXT GENERATION AND INCREASE THE RISK FOR CHRONIC DISEASES IN ADULTHOOD.",NA,"PROTEIN, 67254-75-5; SOMATOMEDIN B, 63774-77-6, 67763-97-7; CELL CYCLE PROTEINS; INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR II; KRUPPEL-LIKE TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; MEMBRANE PROTEINS; MESODERM SPECIFIC TRANSCRIPT PROTEIN; NERVE TISSUE PROTEINS; NNAT PROTEIN, HUMAN; PEG10 PROTEIN, HUMAN; PEG3 PROTEIN, HUMAN; PLAGL1 PROTEIN, HUMAN; PROTEINS; SARCOGLYCANS; SGCE PROTEIN, HUMAN; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; TUMOR SUPPRESSOR PROTEINS","IJOBD","SOUBRY, A.; DUKE CANCER INSTITUTE, DUKE UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTERUNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1038/ijo.2013.193","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH,R25CA126938,P30ES011961,R21ES014947,R01ES016772,R01DK085173 AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETYAMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY,ACS-IRG 83-006","03070565","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,121,"4",NA,"650-657","NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP","24158121","SCOPUS","NEWBORNS OF OBESE PARENTS HAVE ALTERED DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS AT IMPRINTED GENES",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84927073068&doi=10.1038%2fijo.2013.193&partnerID=40&md5=a5e98acc3b3ae961c0433992667ad45a","39",2015,"WE ARE THANKFUL TOWARD THE NEST FAMILIES, VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING IN THIS STUDY.

ECOL.","MANY SPECIES EXHIBIT TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY BY WHICH ENVIRONMENTAL CUES EXPERIENCED BY EITHER PARENT CAN BE TRANSMITTED TO THEIR OFFSPRING, RESULTING IN PHENOTYPIC VARIANTS IN OFFSPRING TO MATCH ANCESTRAL ENVIRONMENTS. HOWEVER, THE MANNER BY WHICH PATERNAL EXPERIENCES AFFECT OFFSPRING PLASTICITY THROUGH EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE IN ANIMALS GENERALLY REMAINS UNCLEAR. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF POPULATION DENSITY ON PHASE-RELATED TRAITS IN THE MIGRATORY LOCUST LOCUSTA MIGRATORIA. USING AN EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN THAT EXPLICITLY CONTROLS GENETIC BACKGROUND, WE FOUND THAT THE EFFECTS OF CROWD OR ISOLATION REARING ON PHASE PLASTICITY COULD BE INHERITED TO THE OFFSPRING. THE ISOLATION OF GREGARIOUS LOCUSTS RESULTED IN REDUCED WEIGHT IN OFFSPRING EGGS AND ALTERED MORPHOMETRIC TRAITS IN HATCHLINGS, WHEREAS CROWDING OF SOLITARIOUS LOCUSTS EXHIBITED OPPOSITE EFFECTS. THE CONSEQUENCES OF DENSITY CHANGES WERE TRANSMITTED BY BOTH MATERNAL AND PATERNAL INHERITANCE, ALTHOUGH THE EXPRESSION OF PATERNAL EFFECTS WAS NOT AS PRONOUNCED AS THAT OF MATERNAL EFFECTS. PROMINENT EXPRESSION OF HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS (HSPS), SUCH AS HSP90, HSP70 AND HSP20.6, COULD BE TRIGGERED BY DENSITY CHANGES. HSPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY UPREGULATED UPON CROWDING BUT DOWNREGULATED UPON ISOLATION. THE VARIATION IN PARENTAL HSP EXPRESSION WAS ALSO TRANSMITTED TO THE OFFSPRING, IN WHICH THE PATTERN OF INHERITANCE WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT OF PHASE CHARACTERISTICS. THESE RESULTS REVEALED A PATERNAL EFFECT ON PHASE POLYPHENISM AND HSP EXPRESSION INDUCED BY POPULATION DENSITY, AND DEFINED A MODEL SYSTEM THAT COULD BE USED TO STUDY THE PATERNAL EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. 2015 JOHN WILEY & SONS LTD.",NA,"HEAT-SHOCK PROTEINS","MOECE","KANG, L.; STATE KEY LABORATORY OF INTEGRATED MANAGEMENT OF PEST INSECTS AND RODENTS, INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY, CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCESCHINA","ARTICLE","10.1111/mec.13072",NA,"09621083","MOLECULAR ECOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,"GENBANK: ABL10073, EF413000, KF804147:KF804150",14,"4",NA,"851-862","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","25581246","SCOPUS","PATERNAL EPIGENETIC EFFECTS OF POPULATION DENSITY ON LOCUST PHASE-RELATED CHARACTERISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH HEAT-SHOCK PROTEIN EXPRESSION",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84923092719&doi=10.1111%2fmec.13072&partnerID=40&md5=6f8b125164565d987c27ce5eecd9b445","24",2015,"NA NA NA","INSTITUTE OF ZOOLOGY;HUAZHONG AGRICULTURAL UNIVERSITY;BEIJING INSTITUTE OF LIFE SCIENCES","NOTREPORTED;CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCESCHINA",NA,"CHEN B, 2015, MOL ECOL","CHEN B, 2015, MOL ECOL"

HEALTH PERSPECT.","BACKGROUND: PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS (POPS) ARE DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICANTS, BUT THE IMPACT OF BOTH MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EXPOSURES ON OFFSPRING BIRTH SIZE IS LARGELY UNEXPLORED. OBJECTIVE: WE EXAMINED ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL SERUM CONCENTRATIONS OF 63 POPS, COMPRISING FIVE MAJOR CLASSES OF POLLUTANTS, WITH BIRTH SIZE MEASURES. METHODS: PARENTAL SERUM CONCENTRATIONS OF 9 ORGANO CHLORINE PESTICIDES, 1 POLYBROMINATED BIPHENYL (PBB), 7 PERFLUOROALKYL CHEMICALS (PFCS), 10 POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS (PBDES), AND 36 POLYCHLORINATED BIPHENYLS (PCBS) WERE MEASURED BEFORE CONCEPTION FOR 234 COUPLES. DIFFERENCES IN BIRTH WEIGHT, LENGTH, HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE, AND PONDERAL INDEX WERE ESTIMATED USING MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION PER 1-SD INCREASE IN NATURAL LOG-TRANSFORMED (LN-TRANSFORMED) CHEMICALS. MODELS WERE ESTIMATED SEPARATELY FOR EACH PARENT AND ADJUSTED FOR MATERNAL AGE, MATERNAL PRE PREGNANCY BODY MASS INDEX (KILOGRAMS PER METER SQUARED) AND OTHER CONFOUNDERS, AND ALL MODELS INCLUDED AN INTERACTION TERM BETWEEN INFANT SEX AND EACH CHEMICAL. RESULTS: AMONG GIRLS (N = 117), BIRTH WEIGHT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (RANGE, 84-195 G) IN ASSOCIATION WITH A 1-SD INCREASE IN LN-TRANSFORMED MATERNAL SERUM CONCENTRATIONS OF DDT, PBDE CON GENERS 28 AND 183, AND PATERNAL SERUM CONCENTRATIONS OF PBDE-183 AND PCB-167. AMONG BOYS (N = 113), MATERNAL (PCBS 138, 153, 167, 170, 195, AND 209 AND PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONAMIDE) AND PATERNAL (PCBS 172 AND 195) SERUM CONCENTRATIONS OF SEVERAL POPS WERE STATISTICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER BIRTH WEIGHT (RANGE, 98-170 G), WHEREAS PATERNAL CONCENTRATIONS OF PBDES (66, 99) WERE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER BIRTH WEIGHT. DIFFERENCES IN OFFSPRING HEAD CIRCUMFERENCE, LENGTH, AND PONDERAL INDEX WERE ALSO ASSOCIATED WITH PARENTAL EXPOSURES. CONCLUSIONS: PRECONCEPTIONAL MATERNAL AND PATERNAL CONCENTRATIONS OF SEVERAL POPS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN BIRTH SIZE AMONG OFFSPRING. 2014, PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, US DEPT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

METHODS LINKAGE OF DATA FROM A LONGITUDINAL OBSERVATIONAL STUDY OF PATIENTS WITH INFLAMMATORY JOINT DISEASE (THE NORWEGIAN DISEASE-MODIFYING ANTIRHEUMATIC DRUG [NOR-DMARD] REGISTRY STUDY) AND THE MEDICAL BIRTH REGISTRY OF NORWAY (MBRN) ENABLED A COMPARISON OF PREGNANCY OUTCOMES IN THE PARTNERS OF MEN WITH INFLAMMATORY JOINT DISEASE. OUTCOMES OF PREGNANCIES IN WHICH THE FATHER WAS EXPOSED TO DMARDS WITHIN 12 WEEKS OF CONCEPTION AND THOSE IN WHICH THE FATHER WAS NEVER EXPOSED TO DMARDS WERE ANALYZED SEPARATELY AND COMPARED WITH THE OUTCOMES IN REFERENCE SUBJECTS. POTENTIAL ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN DMARD EXPOSURE AND ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES WERE ASSESSED BY LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS. RESULTS A TOTAL OF 1,796 MEN WITH INFLAMMATORY JOINT DISEASE WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 2,777 BIRTHS IN THE MBRN. IN 110 OF THESE BIRTHS, THE FATHER HAD BEEN EXPOSED TO DMARDS WITHIN 12 WEEKS BEFORE CONCEPTION, AND IN 230 BIRTHS THE FATHER HAD NEVER BEEN EXPOSED TO DMARDS BEFORE CONCEPTION. THE DMARDS (MONOTHERAPY OR COMBINATION TREATMENT) TO WHICH THE FATHERS WERE EXPOSED MOST FREQUENTLY WITHIN 12 WEEKS OF CONCEPTION WERE METHOTREXATE (N = 49), SULFASALAZINE (N = 17), AND TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR INHIBITORS (N = 57). NEITHER ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES NOR OCCURRENCE OF CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS DIFFERED BETWEEN PATIENTS AND REFERENCE SUBJECTS IN EITHER GROUP. CONCLUSION PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO DMARDS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES. IMPORTANTLY, NO INCREASED RISK OF CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS WAS OBSERVED. 2015 THE AUTHORS.

THIS WORK REPORTS PREGNANCY OUTCOMES IN TERIFLUNOMIDE CLINICAL TRIALS. METHODS: PREGNANCY OUTCOMES WERE EVALUATED IN A RETROSPECTIVE ANALYSIS OF THE GLOBAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE DATABASE. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION WAS COLLECTED FROM THE PHARMACOVIGILANCE DATABASE OR INDIVIDUAL PATIENT FILES: TREATMENT ALLOCATION, PREGNANCY OUTCOME, TERIFLUNOMIDE EXPOSURE, AND USE OF THE ACCELERATED ELIMINATION PROCEDURE. RESULTS: AT DATA CUT-OFF, 83 PREGNANCIES WERE REPORTED IN FEMALE PATIENTS AND 22 PREGNANCIES WERE DOCUMENTED IN PARTNERS OF MALE PATIENTS.

DESPITE LOW INVESTMENT INTO REPRODUCTION, A FATHER'S ENVIRONMENT AND PHENOTYPE CAN SHAPE ITS OFFSPRING'S PHENOTYPE. WHETHER AND WHEN SUCH PATERNAL EFFECTS ARE ADAPTIVE, HOWEVER, REMAINS ELUSIVE. USING THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS IN CONTROLLED INFECTION EXPERIMENTS, WE SHOW THAT SPERM DEFICIENCIES IN EXPOSED MALES COMPARED TO THEIR UNEXPOSED BROTHERS FUNCTIONALLY TRANSLATED INTO REDUCED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS IN SPERM COMPETITION TRIALS. IN NON-COMPETITIVE FERTILISATIONS, OFFSPRING OF EXPOSED MALES SUFFERED SIGNIFICANT COSTS OF REDUCED HATCHING SUCCESS AND SURVIVAL BUT THEY REACHED A HIGHER BODY CONDITION THAN THEIR COUNTERPARTS FROM UNEXPOSED FATHERS AFTER EXPERIMENTAL INFECTION. INTERESTINGLY, THOSE BENEFITS OF PATERNAL INFECTION DID NOT RESULT FROM INCREASED RESISTANCE BUT FROM INCREASED TOLERANCE TO THE PARASITE. ALTOGETHER, THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT PARASITE RESISTANCE AND TOLERANCE ARE SHAPED BY PROCESSES INVOLVING BOTH GENETIC AND NON-GENETIC INHERITANCE AND SUGGEST A CONTEXT-DEPENDENT ADAPTIVE VALUE OF PATERNAL EFFECTS. 2014 THE AUTHORS.",NA,NA,"ECLEF","KAUFMANN, J.; DEPARTMENT OF EVOLUTIONARY ECOLOGY, MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGYGERMANY","ARTICLE","10.1111/ele.12344","DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTDEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT,DFG,EI 841/6-1 DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTDEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFT,DFG,EI841/4-1","1461023X","ECOLOGY LETTERS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,15,"11",NA,"1409-1417","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","25168056","SCOPUS","EXPERIMENTAL PARASITE INFECTION REVEALS COSTS AND BENEFITS OF PATERNAL EFFECTS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84907859324&doi=10.1111%2fele.12344&partnerID=40&md5=069f2f5159bf5b0a2e23f531e63d3b1d","17",2014,"NA NA NA","MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY;HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL;HELMHOLTZ CENTRE FOR OCEAN RESEARCH;QUEEN MARY UNIVERSITY OF LONDON","NOTREPORTED;MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGYGERMANY",NA,"KAUFMANN J, 2014, ECOL LETT","KAUFMANN J, 2014, ECOL LETT"

IT IS CURRENTLY UNCLEAR HOW SUCH PROTECTION IS TRANSFERRED, AS IN CONTRAST TO MOTHERS, FATHERS DO NOT DIRECTLY PROVIDE OFFSPRING WITH A LARGEAMOUNT OF SUBSTANCES. IN ADDITION TO SPERM, MALE FLOUR BEETLES TRANSFER SEMINAL FLUIDS IN A SPERMATOPHORE TO FEMALES DURING COPULATION. DEPENDING ON WHETHER PATERNAL TRANS-GENERATIONAL IMMUNE PRIMING IS MEDIATED BY SPERM OR SEMINAL FLUIDS, IT IS EXPECTED TO EITHER AFFECT ONLY THE GENETIC OFFSPRING OF A MALE, OR ALSO THEIR STEP OFFSPRING THAT ARE SIRED BY ANOTHER MALE. WE THEREFORE CONDUCTED A DOUBLE-MATING EXPERIMENT AND FOUND THAT ONLY THE GENETIC OFFSPRING OF AN IMMUNE PRIMED MALE SHOW ENHANCED SURVIVAL UPON BACTERIAL CHALLENGE, WHILE PHENOLOXIDASE ACTIVITY, AN IMPORTANT INSECT IMMUNE TRAIT, AND THE EXPRESSION OF THE IMMUNE RECEPTOR PGRP WERE INCREASED IN ALL OFFSPRING. THIS INDICATES THAT INFORMATION LEADING TO ENHANCED SURVIVAL UPON PATHOGEN EXPOSURE IS TRANSFERRED VIA SPERM, AND THUS POTENTIALLY CONSTITUTES AN EPIGENETIC EFFECT, WHEREAS SUBSTANCES TRANSFERRED WITH THE SEMINAL FLUID COULD HAVE AN ADDITIONAL INFLUENCE ON OFFSPRING IMMUNE TRAITS AND IMMUNOLOGICAL ALERTNESS. 2014 THE AUTHORS.","20142089","MONOPHENOL MONOOXYGENASE, 9002-10-2; INSECT PROTEINS; MONOPHENOL MONOOXYGENASE","PRLBA","EGGERT, H.; INSTITUTE FOR EVOLUTION AND BIODIVERSITY, WESTFLISCHE WILHELMS-UNIVERSITT MNSTER, HFFERSTRAE 1, GERMANY","ARTICLE","10.1098/rspb.2014.2089",NA,"09628452","PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B: BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES","ENGLISH",NA,NA,35,"1797","9",NA,"ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON","25355479","SCOPUS","DIFFERENT EFFECTS OF PATERNAL TRANSGENERATIONAL IMMUNE PRIMING ON SURVIVAL AND IMMUNITY IN STEP AND GENETIC OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84908374130&doi=10.1098%2frspb.2014.2089&partnerID=40&md5=b91868ad98921764141542c805cca3aa","281",2014,"NA NA NA","WESTFLISCHE WILHELMS-UNIVERSITT MNSTER","NOTREPORTED;WESTFLISCHE WILHELMS-UNIVERSITT MNSTER",NA,"EGGERT H, 2014, PROC R SOC B BIOL SCI","EGGERT H, 2014, PROC R SOC B BIOL SCI"

NONETHELESS, THE EVOLUTIONARY IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH PARENTAL EFFECTS REMAIN UNCLEAR, PARTLY BECAUSE PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE GENERALLY OVERLOOKED THE POTENTIAL FOR INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARENTAL SOURCES OF NON-GENETIC VARIANCE TO INFLUENCE PATTERNS OF OFFSPRING PHENOTYPIC EXPRESSION. WE TESTED FOR SUCH INTERACTIONS, SUBJECTING MALE AND FEMALE DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER OF TWO DIFFERENT AGE CLASSES TO AN IMMUNE ACTIVATION CHALLENGE OR A CONTROL TREATMENT. FLIES WERE THEN CROSSED IN ALL AGE AND IMMUNE STATUS COMBINATIONS, AND THE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS OF THEIR IMMUNE- AND CONTROL-TREATED DAUGHTERS MEASURED. WE FOUND THAT DAUGHTERS PRODUCED BY TWO YOUNGER PARENTS EXHIBITED REDUCED REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS RELATIVE TO THOSE OF OTHER PARENTAL AGE COMBINATIONS. FURTHERMORE, IMMUNE-CHALLENGED DAUGHTERS EXHIBITED HIGHER REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS WHEN PRODUCED BY IMMUNE-CHALLENGED RELATIVE TO CONTROL-TREATED MOTHERS, A PATTERN CONSISTENT WITH TRANSGENERATIONAL IMMUNE PRIMING. FINALLY, A COMPLEX INTERPLAY BETWEEN PATERNAL AGE AND PARENTAL IMMUNE STATUSES INFLUENCED DAUGHTERS REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. THESE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THE DYNAMIC NATURE OF AGE- AND IMMUNE-MEDIATED PARENTAL EFFECTS, TRACEABLE TO BOTH PARENTS, AND REGULATED BY INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARENTS AND BETWEEN PARENTS AND OFFSPRING. 2014 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY.

ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS GENE VARIANTS HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH AUD, THESE VARIANTS ACCOUNT FOR ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE TOTAL RISK. THE IDEA OF INHERITANCE OF ACQUIRED CHARACTERISTICS, I.E. ""EPIGENETIC INHERITANCE,"" IS RE-EMERGING AS A PROVEN ADJUNCT TO TRADITIONAL MODES OF GENETIC INHERITANCE. WE HYPOTHESIZED THAT ALCOHOL DRINKING AND NEUROBIOLOGICAL SENSITIVITY TO ALCOHOL ARE INFLUENCED BY ANCESTRAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE. TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE EXPOSED MALE MICE TO CHRONIC VAPOR ETHANOL OR CONTROL CONDITIONS, MATED THEM TO ETHANOL-NAVE FEMALES, AND TESTED ADULT OFFSPRING FOR ETHANOL DRINKING, ETHANOL-INDUCED BEHAVIORS, GENE EXPRESSION, AND DNA METHYLATION. WE FOUND THAT ETHANOL-SIRED MALE OFFSPRING HAD REDUCED ETHANOL PREFERENCE AND CONSUMPTION, ENHANCED SENSITIVITY TO THE ANXIOLYTIC AND MOTOR-ENHANCING EFFECTS OF ETHANOL, AND INCREASED BDNF EXPRESSION IN THE VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA (VTA) COMPARED TO CONTROL-SIRED MALE OFFSPRING. THERE WERE NO DIFFERENCES AMONG ETHANOL- AND CONTROL-SIRED FEMALE OFFSPRING ON THESE ASSAYS. ETHANOL EXPOSURE ALSO DECREASED DNA METHYLATION AT THE BDNFPROMOTER OF SIRE'S GERM CELLS AND HYPOMETHYLATION WAS MAINTAINED IN THE VTA OF BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ETHANOL-SIRED OFFSPRING. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE IS A PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED REGULATOR OF ALCOHOL DRINKING AND BEHAVIORAL SENSITIVITY TO ALCOHOL IN MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE, OFFSPRING. PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE ALSO INDUCES EPIGENETIC ALTERATIONS (DNA HYPOMETHYLATION) AND GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES THAT PERSIST IN THE VTA OF OFFSPRING. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE NEW INSIGHT INTO THE INHERITANCE AND DEVELOPMENT OF ALCOHOL DRINKING BEHAVIORS. 2014 FINEGERSH, HOMANICS.","E99078","ALCOHOL, 64-17-5; BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR, 218441-99-7; BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANTS; ETHANOL","POLNC",NA,"ARTICLE","10.1371/journal.pone.0099078",NA,"19326203","PLOS ONE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,41,"6",NA,NA,"PUBLIC LIBRARY OF SCIENCE","24896617","SCOPUS","PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE REDUCES ALCOHOL DRINKING AND INCREASES BEHAVIORAL SENSITIVITY TO ALCOHOL SELECTIVELY IN MALE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84902440644&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0099078&partnerID=40&md5=6f77c9420302acd8fe9beaf735ce072b","9",2014,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH","UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH",NA,"FINEGERSH A, 2014, PLOS ONE","FINEGERSH A, 2014, PLOS ONE"

METHYLATION ALTERATIONS IN IMPRINTED GENES MAY BE RELATED TO THE WELL-DOCUMENTED TERATOGENIC EFFECTS OF ETHANOL. HERE, WE REPORT THAT ETHANOL (0, 1.1, 3.3 G/KG) WAS ADMINISTERED INTRAGASTRICALLY TO MALE MICE AND A BEHAVIORAL STUDY WAS PERFORMED ON THEIR F1 GENERATION. DATA SHOW THAT F1 MICE WITH FATHERS EXPOSED TO THE HIGHEST DOSE OF ETHANOL HAD DELAYED COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE AND INCREASED ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION. A SPECIFIC CIRCLING BEHAVIOR WAS OBSERVED IN THE OFFSPRING OF THE PATERNALLY ETHANOL-EXPOSED GROUP. THE DEGREE OF METHYLATION AND MRNA EXPRESSION OF H19, PEG3, NDN AND SNRPN WERE ASSESSED IN PATERNAL SPERM AND IN THE CEREBRAL CORTICES OF EACH OFFSPRING. IT DID AFFECT METHYLATION IN PATERNAL SPERM (H19 AND PEG3) AND IN THE OFFSPRING'S CEREBRAL CORTICES (CPG7 AND CPG11 IN PEG3 AND SNRPN), BUT THE LEVEL OF MRNA EXPRESSION HAS NOT CHANGED. IN THE CIRCLING MICE, THE HIGHEST ETHANOL EXPOSURE INCREASE IN METHYLATION (CPG 1, 2, 7 AND 11) AND DECREASES IN MRNA OF PEG3.THUS, CHRONIC PATERNAL ETHANOL EXPOSURE CAN AFFECT THE METHYLATION OF IMPRINTED GENES IN SIRE SPERM THAT MAY BE PASSED ON TO OFFSPRING, GIVING RISE TO MENTAL DEFICITS. 2014 ELSEVIER LTD.

THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PROSPECTIVE, COLLABORATIVE STUDY, WAS TO ASSESS OUTCOMES OF PREGNANCIES FATHERED BY MS PATIENTS UNDERGOING DMD.METHODS: STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS ON PREGNANCIES FATHERED BY MS PATIENTS GATHERED IN THE ITALIAN PREGNANCY DATASET WERE COLLECTED; PREGNANCIES WERE DIVIDED ACCORDING TO FATHER EXPOSURE OR UNEXPOSURE TO DMD AT TIME OF PROCREATION. TREATMENT WERE COMPARED WITH MULTIVARIABLE LOGISTIC AND LINEAR MODELS.RESULTS: SEVENTY-EIGHT PREGNANCIES FATHERED BY MS PATIENTS WERE TRACKED. FORTY-FIVE PATIENTS WERE TAKING DMD AT TIME OF CONCEPTION (39 BETA-INTERFERONS, 6 GLATIRAMER ACETATE), WHILE 33 PREGNANCIES WERE UNEXPOSED TO DMD. SEVENTY-FIVE PREGNANCIES ENDED IN LIVE-BIRTHS, 44 IN THE EXPOSED AND 31 IN THE UNEXPOSED GROUP. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO GROUPS WERE FOUND IN THE RISK OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION OR MALFORMATIONS (P > 0.454), MEAN GESTATIONAL AGE (P = 0.513), FREQUENCY OF CESAREAN DELIVERY (P = 0.644), BIRTH WEIGHT (P = 0.821) AND BIRTH LENGTH (P = 0.649). IN COMPARISON WITH DATA OF THE ITALIAN GENERAL POPULATION, THE PROPORTION OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION AND CAESAREAN DELIVERY IN EXPOSED PREGNANCIES FELL WITHIN THE ESTIMATES, WHILE THE PROPORTION OF PRE-TERM DELIVERY IN THE EXPOSED GROUP WAS HIGHER THAN EXPECTED.CONCLUSIONS: OUR DATA INDICATE NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATERNAL DMD EXPOSURE AT TIME OF CONCEPTION AND RISK OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION, ADVERSE FETAL OUTCOMES AND CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS.

WHILE THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF EPIGENETIC EFFECTS TRANSMITTED FROM THE MOTHER TO THE OFFSPRING HAVE RECEIVED AMPLE ATTENTION, MUCH LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW VARIATION IN THE CONDITION OF THE FATHER AFFECTS THE OFFSPRING. HERE, WE MANIPULATED THE INTENSITY OF SPERM COMPETITION EXPERIENCED BY MALE ZEBRAFISH DANIO RERIO TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL FOR SPERM-MEDIATED EPIGENETIC EFFECTS OVER A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. WE FOUND THAT THE RAPID RESPONSES OF MALES TO VARYING INTENSITY OF SPERM COMPETITION NOT ONLY AFFECTED SPERM TRAITS AS SHOWN PREVIOUSLY, BUT ALSO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RESULTING OFFSPRING. WE OBSERVED THAT MALES EXPOSED TO HIGH INTENSITY OF SPERM COMPETITION PRODUCED FASTER SWIMMING AND MORE MOTILE SPERM, AND SIRED OFFSPRING THAT HATCHED OVER A NARROWER TIME FRAME BUT EXHIBITED A LOWER SURVIVAL RATE THAN MALES EXPOSED TO LOW INTENSITY OF SPERM COMPETITION. OUR RESULTS PROVIDE STRIKING EVIDENCE FOR SHORT-TERM PATERNAL EFFECTS AND THE POSSIBLE FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH SPERM-MEDIATED NON-GENETIC FACTORS NOT ONLY FOR THE RESULTING OFFSPRING BUT ALSO FOR THE FEMALE. 2014 THE AUTHOR(S) PUBLISHED BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY.

IN ANIMAL STUDIES, BPA HAS BEEN SHOWN TO DISRUPT PANCREATIC FUNCTION AND BLOOD GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS EVEN AT A REFERENCE 'SAFE' LEVEL DURING PERINATAL PERIOD. IN THIS STUDY, WE EXPLORED THE EFFECTS OF LONG-TERM PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO A 'SAFE' LEVEL OF BPA ON PARENTS THEMSELVES AND THEIR OFFSPRING. ADULT MALE GENITOR RATS FED WITH EITHER STANDARD CHOW DIET (STD) OR HIGH-FAT DIET (HFD) WERE TREATED RESPECTIVELY WITH EITHER VEHICLE OR BPA (50 G/KG PER DAY) FOR 35 WEEKS. THE MALE RATS TREATED WITH VEHICLE OR BPA FOR 21 WEEKS WERE THEN USED AS SIRES, AND THE ADULT FEMALE RATS WERE FED WITH STD DURING THE GESTATION AND LACTATION. OFFSPRING RATS WERE WEANED ON POSTNATAL DAY 21 AND FED WITH STD IN LATER LIFE. METABOLIC PARAMETERS WERE RECORDED ON THE ADULT MALE RATS AND THEIR ADULT OFFSPRING. BPA EXPOSURE DISRUPTED GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS AND PANCREATIC FUNCTION, AND HFD AGGRAVATED THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS. HOWEVER, BPA EXPOSURE DID NOT ALTER BODY WEIGHT, BODY FAT PERCENTAGE, OR SERUM LIPID. IN ADDITION, THE PATERNAL BPA EXPOSURE DID NOT CAUSE ADVERSE REPRODUCTIVE CONSEQUENCE OR METABOLIC DISORDER IN THE ADULT OFFSPRING. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO A PREDICTED 'SAFE' DOSE OF BPA CONTRIBUTES TO GLUCOSE METABOLIC DISORDERS, AND THAT HFD AGGRAVATES THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS IN PATERNAL RATS. 2014 SOCIETY FOR ENDOCRINOLOGY.",NA,"4,4' ISOPROPYLIDENEDIPHENOL, 80-05-7; GLUCOSE, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; LIPID, 66455-18-3","JOENA","YING, C.; DEPARTMENT OF NUTRITION AND FOOD HYGIENE, TONGJI MEDICAL COLLEGE, HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, 13 HANGKONG ROAD, WUHAN 430030, CHINA; EMAIL: YINGCJ@HUST.EDU.CN","ARTICLE","10.1530/JOE-13-0386",NA,"00220795","JOURNAL OF ENDOCRINOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,30,"1",NA,"167-179",NA,"24501380","SCOPUS","HIGH-FAT DIET AGGRAVATES GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS DISORDER CAUSED BY CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO BISPHENOL A",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84897889829&doi=10.1530%2fJOE-13-0386&partnerID=40&md5=0db79267bbcd83087eb04841312a2a48","221",2014,"NA NA NA","HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;WENZHOU MEDICAL COLLEGE","NOTREPORTED;HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"DING S, 2014, J ENDOCRINOL","DING S, 2014, J ENDOCRINOL"

THE PRECISE MECHANISM(S) MEDIATING THE PATERNAL AGE EFFECT ARE NOT KNOWN, BUT THEY ARE THOUGHT TO INVOLVE THE ACCUMULATION OF DE NOVO (EPI)GENOMIC ALTERATIONS. IN THIS STUDY WE INVESTIGATE DIFFERENCES IN THE FRONTAL CORTEX TRANSCRIPTOME IN A MOUSE MODEL OF ADVANCED PATERNAL AGE. FINDINGS. TRANSCRIPTOMIC PROFILING WAS UNDERTAKEN FOR MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX TISSUE DISSECTED FROM THE MALE OFFSPRING OF YOUNG FATHERS (2 MONTH OLD, 4 SIRES, N = 16 OFFSPRING) AND OLD FATHERS (10 MONTH OLD, 6 SIRES, N = 16 OFFSPRING) IN A MOUSE MODEL OF ADVANCING PATERNAL AGE. WE FOUND A NUMBER OF DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED GENES IN THE OFFSPRING OF OLDER FATHERS, MANY PREVIOUSLY IMPLICATED IN THE AETIOLOGY OF AUTISM. PATHWAY ANALYSIS HIGHLIGHTED SIGNIFICANT ENRICHMENT FOR CHANGES IN FUNCTIONAL NETWORKS INVOLVED IN INFLAMMATION AND INFLAMMATORY DISEASE, WHICH ARE ALSO IMPLICATED IN AUTISM.

NATL. ACAD. SCI. U. S. A.","PATERNAL CHARACTERISTICS AND EXPOSURES INFLUENCE PHYSIOLOGY AND DISEASE RISKS IN PROGENY, BUT THE MECHANISMS ARE MOSTLY UNKNOWN. SEMINAL FLUID, WHICH AFFECTS FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE TRACT GENE EXPRESSION AS WELL AS SPERM SURVIVAL AND INTEGRITY, PROVIDES ONE POTENTIAL PATHWAY. WE EVALUATED IN MICE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR OFFSPRING OF ABLATING THE PLASMA FRACTION OF SEMINAL FLUID BY SURGICAL EXCISION OF THE SEMINAL VESICLE GLAND. CONCEPTION WAS SUBSTANTIALLY IMPAIRED AND, WHEN PREGNANCY DID OCCUR, PLACENTAL HYPERTROPHY WAS EVIDENT IN LATE GESTATION. AFTER BIRTH, THE GROWTH TRAJECTORY AND METABOLIC PARAMETERS OF PROGENY WERE ALTERED, MOST PROFOUNDLY IN MALES, WHICH EXHIBITED OBESITY, DISTORTED METABOLIC HORMONES, REDUCED GLUCOSE TOLERANCE, AND HYPERTENSION. ALTERED OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE WAS PARTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SPERM DAMAGE AND PARTLY TO AN EFFECT OF SEMINAL FLUID DEFICIENCY ON THE FEMALE TRACT, BECAUSE INCREASED ADIPOSITY WAS ALSO EVIDENT IN ADULT MALE PROGENY WHEN NORMAL TWO-CELL EMBRYOS WERE TRANSFERRED TO FEMALES MATED WITH SEMINAL VESICLE-EXCISED MALES. MOREOVER, EMBRYOS DEVELOPED IN FEMALE TRACTS NOT EXPOSED TO SEMINAL PLASMA WERE ABNORMAL FROM THE EARLY CLEAVAGE STAGES, BUT CULTURE IN VITRO PARTLY ALLEVIATED THIS. ABSENCE OF SEMINAL PLASMA WAS ACCOMPANIED BY DOWN-REGULATION OF THE EMBRYOTROPHIC FACTORS LIF, CSF2, IL6, AND EGF AND UP-REGULATION OF THE APOPTOSIS-INDUCING FACTOR TRAIL IN THE OVIDUCT. THESE FINDINGS SHOW THAT PATERNAL SEMINAL FLUID COMPOSITION AFFECTS THE GROWTH AND HEALTH OF MALE OFFSPRING, AND REVEAL THAT ITS IMPACT ON THE PERICONCEPTION ENVIRONMENT INVOLVES NOT ONLY SPERM PROTECTION BUT ALSO INDIRECT EFFECTS ON PREIMPLANTATION EMBRYOS VIA OVIDUCT EXPRESSION OF EMBRYOTROPHIC CYTOKINES.",NA,NA,"PNASA","ROBERTSON, S.A.; ROBINSON INSTITUTE, UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE, ADELAIDE, SA 5005, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: SARAH.ROBERTSON@ADELAIDE.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.1073/pnas.1305609111",NA,"00278424","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","ENGLISH",NA,NA,159,"6",NA,"2200-2205",NA,"24469827","SCOPUS","MATERNAL TRACT FACTORS CONTRIBUTE TO PATERNAL SEMINAL FLUID IMPACT ON METABOLIC PHENOTYPE IN OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84893849120&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.1305609111&partnerID=40&md5=6a5ce85e2677351f167bc6575c60e9c3","111",2014,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE;UNIVERSITY OF FLORIDA","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BROMFIELD JJ, 2014, PROC NATL ACAD SCI U S A","BROMFIELD JJ, 2014, PROC NATL ACAD SCI U S A"

THIS STUDY EVALUATES THE PROPHYLACTIC EFFECT OF THYMOQUINONE SUPPLEMENTATION ON CULTURE MEDIUM TO AMELIORATE CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE-INDUCED ALTERATIONS IN CELLULAR DIFFERENTIATION AND PROLIFERATION DURING EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT IN VITRO. MALE AND FEMALE MICE WERE EXPOSED TO CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE VIA A SINGLE INTRAPERITONEAL (I.P.) INJECTION AT 200 MG/KG. SPERMS AND OOCYTES WERE COLLECTED AT DAY 33 AND DAY 10 RESPECTIVELY, FOR INSEMINATION AND FERTILIZATION IN MEDIUM SUPPLEMENTED WITH THYMOQUINONE (1M, 10M AND 100M). THE STAGES OF FERTILIZATION, EMBRYO DIVISION, MORPHOLOGICAL EFFECTS AND FRAGMENTATION WERE EXAMINED AND COMPARED BETWEEN GROUPS, 24 HOURS POST-FERTILIZATION. THYMOQUINONE SUPPLEMENTATION IMPROVED FERTILIZATION RATES, SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE PERCENTAGE OF DEFECTS BLASTOMERES OF TYPE C (P<0.001) AND SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED THE PERCENTAGE OF EMBRYO FRAGMENTATION GRADE IV (>50%, P<0.05) FOLLOWING PATERNAL AND MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE. THE GOOD QUALITY EMBRYOS OF TYPE A AND GRADE I FRAGMENTATION WERE NOT OBSERVED IN THE GROUP WITHOUT THYMOQUINONE SUPPLEMENTATION. THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SHOWED THAT THYMOQUINONE IS A SUITABLE EXOGENOUS ANTIOXIDANT FOR PRESERVING FAIR-QUALITY EMBRYOS WHICH CAN RESULT INTO FULL TERM PREGNANCY.

LONG-TERM ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF CHRONIC OPIATE EXPOSURE NOT ONLY INVOLVE THE INDIVIDUALS THEMSELVES BUT ALSO THEIR OFFSPRING. ADOLESCENT MATERNAL MORPHINE EXPOSURE RESULTS IN BEHAVIOR AND MORPHOLOGIC CHANGES IN THE BRAIN OF THEIR ADULT OFFSPRING. HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF ADULT OPIATE EXPOSURE ON THEIR OFFSPRING. FURTHERMORE, THE UNDERLYING MOLECULAR SIGNALS REGULATING THE INTERGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF MORPHINE EXPOSURE ARE STILL ELUSIVE. WE REPORT HERE THAT MORPHINE EXPOSURE OF ADULT MALE AND FEMALE RATS RESULTED IN ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR AND DENDRITIC RETRACTION IN THE DENTATE GYRUS (DG) REGION OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS IN THEIR ADULT OFFSPRING. THE BEHAVIOR AND MORPHOLOGIC CHANGES WERE CONCOMITANT WITH THE DOWNREGULATION OF INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR (IGF)-2 SIGNALING IN THE GRANULAR ZONE OF DG. OVEREXPRESSION OF HIPPOCAMPAL IGF-2 BY BILATERAL INTRA-DG INJECTION OF LENTIVIRUS ENCODING THE IGF-2 GENE PREVENTED ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIORS IN THE OFFSPRING. FURTHERMORE, EXPOSURE TO AN ENRICHED ENVIRONMENT DURING ADOLESCENCE CORRECTED THE REDUCTION OF HIPPOCAMPAL IGF-2 EXPRESSION, NORMALIZED ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR AND REVERSED DENDRITIC RETRACTION IN THE ADULT OFFSPRING. THUS, PARENTAL MORPHINE EXPOSURE CAN LEAD TO THE DOWNREGULATION OF HIPPOCAMPAL IGF-2, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE ANXIETY AND HIPPOCAMPAL DENDRITIC RETRACTION IN THEIR OFFSPRING. AN ADOLESCENT-ENRICHED ENVIRONMENT EXPERIENCE PREVENTED THE BEHAVIOR AND MORPHOLOGIC CHANGES IN THEIR OFFSPRING THROUGH HIPPOCAMPAL IGF-2 SIGNALING. IGF-2 AND AN ENRICHED ENVIRONMENT MAY BE A POTENTIAL INTERVENTION TO PREVENTION OF ANXIETY AND BRAIN ATROPHY IN THE OFFSPRING OF PARENTAL OPIOID EXPOSURE. 2014 AMERICAN COLLEGE OF NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY.

YET, LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW LONG THESE EFFECTS PERSIST AND WHETHER THEY ARE CUMULATIVE OVER GENERATIONS. HERE, WE TESTED FOR ADAPTIVE TGP IN RESPONSE TO SIMULATED OCEAN WARMING ACROSS PARENTAL AND GRANDPARENTAL GENERATIONS OF MARINE STICKLEBACKS. GRANDPARENTS WERE ACCLIMATED FOR TWO MONTHS DURING REPRODUCTIVE CONDITIONING, WHEREAS PARENTS EXPERIENCED DEVELOPMENTAL ACCLIMATION, ALLOWING US TO COMPARE THE FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF SHORT-TERM VS. PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO ELEVATED TEMPERATURE ACROSS MULTIPLE GENERATIONS. WE FOUND THAT REPRODUCTIVE OUTPUT OF F1 ADULTS WAS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY MATERNAL DEVELOPMENTAL TEMPERATURE, BUT CARRY-OVER EFFECTS FROM GRANDPARENTAL ACCLIMATION ENVIRONMENTS RESULTED IN CUMULATIVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF ELEVATED TEMPERATURE ON HATCHING SUCCESS. IN VERY EARLY STAGES OF GROWTH, F2 OFFSPRING REACHED LARGER SIZES IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PATERNAL AND GRANDPARENTAL ENVIRONMENT DOWN THE PATERNAL LINE, SUGGESTING THAT OTHER FACTORS THAN JUST THE PATERNAL GENOME MAY BE TRANSFERRED BETWEEN GENERATIONS. IN LATER GROWTH STAGES, MATERNAL AND MATERNAL GRANDDAM ENVIRONMENTS STRONGLY INFLUENCED OFFSPRING BODY SIZE, BUT IN OPPOSING DIRECTIONS, INDICATING THAT THE MECHANISM(S) UNDERLYING THE TRANSFER OF ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION MAY HAVE DIFFERED BETWEEN ACUTE AND DEVELOPMENTAL ACCLIMATION EXPERIENCED BY THE TWO GENERATIONS. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THE FITNESS CONSEQUENCES OF PARENTAL AND GRANDPARENTAL TGP ARE HIGHLY CONTEXT DEPENDENT, BUT WILL PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN MEDIATING SOME OF THE IMPACTS OF RAPID CLIMATE CHANGE IN THIS SYSTEM. 2014 EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY.",NA,NA,"JEBIE","SHAMA, L.N.S.; AWI WATTENMEERSTATION SYLT, HAFENSTRASSE 43, GERMANY","ARTICLE","10.1111/jeb.12490",NA,"1010061X","JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,51,"11",NA,"2297-2307","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","25264208","SCOPUS","GRANDPARENTAL EFFECTS IN MARINE STICKLEBACKS: TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY ACROSS MULTIPLE GENERATIONS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84925203411&doi=10.1111%2fjeb.12490&partnerID=40&md5=2c6c8c56a949bbfaff8f6908ecbf8ed4","27",2014,"NA NA NA","ALFRED-WEGENER-INSTITUT HELMHOLTZ-ZENTRUM FR POLAR- UND MEERESFORSCHUNG","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SHAMA LNS, 2014, J EVOL BIOL","SHAMA LNS, 2014, J EVOL BIOL"

PSYCHIATRY","OBJECTIVE: DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER (PTSD) HAVE BEEN OBSERVED IN ADULT OFFSPRING OF HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS IN BOTH GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR SENSITIVITY AND VULNERABILITY TO PSYCHIATRIC DISORDER. THE AUTHORS EXAMINED THE RELATIVE INFLUENCES OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PTSD ON DNA METHYLATION OF THE EXON 1+F PROMOTER OF THE GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR (GR1+F) GENE (NR3C1) IN PERIPHERAL BLOOD MONONUCLEAR CELLS AND ITS RELATIONSHIP TO GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR SENSITIVITY IN HOLOCAUST OFFSPRING. METHOD: ADULT OFFSPRING WITH AT LEAST ONE HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR PARENT (N=80) AND DEMOGRAPHICALLY SIMILAR PARTICIPANTS WITHOUT PARENTAL HOLOCAUST EXPOSURE OR PARENTAL PTSD (N=15) COMPLETED CLINICAL INTERVIEWS, SELF-REPORT MEASURES, AND BIOLOGICAL PROCEDURES. BLOOD SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FOR ANALYSIS OF GR1F+ PROMOTER METHYLATION AND OF CORTISOL LEVELS IN RESPONSE TO LOWDOSE DEXAMETHASONE,AND TWOWAY ANALYSIS OF COVARIANCE WAS PERFORMED USING MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PTSD AS MAIN EFFECTS. HIERARCHICAL CLUSTERING ANALYSIS WAS USED TO PERMIT VISUALIZATION OF MATERNAL COMPARED WITH PATERNAL PTSD EFFECTS ON CLINICAL VARIABLES AND GR1+F PROMOTER METHYLATION. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT INTERACTION DEMONSTRATED THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF MATERNAL PTSD, OFFSPRING WITH PATERNAL PTSD SHOWED HIGHER GR1F+ PROMOTER METHYLATION, WHEREAS OFFSPRING WITH BOTH MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PTSD SHOWED LOWER METHYLATION. LOWER GR1+F PROMOTER METHYLATION WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER POSTDEXAMETHASONE CORTISOL SUPPRESSION. THE CLUSTERING ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT MATERNAL AND PATERNAL PTSD EFFECTS WERE DIFFERENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH CLINICAL INDICATORS AND GR1F+ PROMOTER METHYLATION. CONCLUSIONS: THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO DEMONSTRATE ALTERATIONS OF GR1F+ PROMOTER METHYLATION IN RELATION TO PARENTAL PTSD AND NEUROENDOCRINE OUTCOMES.

ENTOMOL. RES.","COMPONENTS OF MALE SEMINAL FLUIDS ARE KNOWN TO STIMULATE FECUNDITY AND FERTILITY IN FEMALES OF NUMEROUS INSECT SPECIES AND PATERNAL EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE ARE ALSO KNOWN, BUT NO STUDIES HAVE YET DEMONSTRATED LINKS BETWEEN MALE EFFECTS ON FEMALE REPRODUCTION AND THOSE ON PROGENY PHENOTYPE. IN SEPARATE LABORATORY EXPERIMENTS EMPLOYING 10-DAY-OLD VIRGIN FEMALES OF CHEILOMENES SEXMACULATA (F.), WE VARIED MALE AGE AND MATING HISTORY TO MANIPULATE LEVELS OF MALE ALLOMONES AND FOUND THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF PATERNAL EFFECTS ON PROGENY PHENOTYPE WAS CORRELATED WITH STIMULATION OF FEMALE REPRODUCTION. OLDER VIRGIN MALES REMAINED IN COPULA LONGER THAN YOUNGER ONES, INDUCED HIGHER LEVELS OF FEMALE FECUNDITY, AND SIRED PROGENY THAT DEVELOPED FASTER TO YIELD HEAVIER ADULTS. WHEN MALE AGE WAS HELD CONSTANT (13 DAYS), EGG FERTILITY DECLINED AS A FUNCTION OF PREVIOUS MALE COPULATIONS, PROGENY DEVELOPMENTAL TIMES INCREASED, AND THE ADULT WEIGHT OF DAUGHTERS DECLINED. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MALE EPIGENETIC EFFECTS ON PROGENY PHENOTYPE ACT IN CONCERT WITH FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE STIMULATION; BOTH CATEGORIES OF EFFECTS INCREASED AS A CONSEQUENCE OF MALE CELIBACY (FACTOR ACCUMULATION), AND DIMINISHED AS A FUNCTION OF PREVIOUS MATINGS (FACTOR DEPLETION). MALE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE FEMALE REPRODUCTION ARE IMPLICATED IN SEXUAL CONFLICT AND PARENTAL EFFECTS MAY EXTEND THIS CONFLICT TO OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE. WHEREAS MOTHERS CONTROL THE TIMING OF OVIPOSITION EVENTS AND CAN USE MATERNAL EFFECTS TO TAILOR PROGENY PHENOTYPES TO PREVAILING OR ANTICIPATED CONDITIONS, FATHERS CANNOT. SINCE FEMALES REMATE AND DILUTE PATERNITY IN POLYANDROUS SYSTEMS, PATERNAL FITNESS WILL BE INCREASED BY LINKING PATERNAL EFFECTS TO FEMALE FECUNDITY STIMULATION, SO THAT MORE BENEFITS ACCRUE TO THE MALE'S OWN PROGENY. 2014 CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS.",NA,"PHEROMONES","BEREA","MICHAUD, J.P.; DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY, KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY, AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH CENTER-HAYS, HAYS, KS, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: JPMI@KSU.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1017/S0007485314000194",NA,"00074853","BULLETIN OF ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH","ENGLISH",NA,NA,12,"4",NA,"480-485","CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS","24661646","SCOPUS","PATERNAL EFFECTS CORRELATE WITH FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE STIMULATION IN THE POLYANDROUS LADYBIRD CHEILOMENES SEXMACULATA",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84903603978&doi=10.1017%2fS0007485314000194&partnerID=40&md5=3376bc8e872787320bdb6d1c88756c94","104",2014,"NA NA NA","VALI-E-ASR UNIVERSITY OF RAFSANJAN;KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MIRHOSSEINI MA, 2014, BULL ENTOMOL RES","MIRHOSSEINI MA, 2014, BULL ENTOMOL RES"

BIOL.","SOME STUDIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT ELEVATED CO2 CONCENTRATIONS IN OCEAN WATERS NEGATIVELY IMPACT METABOLISM AND DEVELOPMENT OF MARINE FISH. PARTICULARLY, EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL STAGES ARE PROBABLY MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO OCEAN ACIDIFICATION DUE TO INSUFFICIENT REGULATIONS OF THEIR ACID-BASE BALANCE. TRANSGENERATIONAL ACCLIMATION CAN BE AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM TO MEDIATE IMPACTS OF INCREASED CO2 ON MARINE SPECIES, YET VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF PARENTAL EFFECTS IN TELEOSTS. THEREFORE, TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS WERE INVESTIGATED ON LIFE HISTORY IN JUVENILE THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS GASTEROSTEUS ACULEATUS BY ACCLIMATING PARENTS (COLLECTED IN APRIL 2012, 5503N, 844E) AND OFFSPRING TO AMBIENT (~400 ATM) AND ELEVATED (~1,000 ATM) CO2 LEVELS AND MEASURED PARENTAL FECUNDITY AS WELL AS OFFSPRING SURVIVAL, GROWTH AND OTOLITH CHARACTERISTICS. EXPOSURE TO ELEVATED CO2 CONCENTRATIONS LED TO AN INCREASE IN CLUTCH SIZE IN ADULTS AS WELL AS INCREASED JUVENILE SURVIVAL AND GROWTH RATES BETWEEN 60 AND 90 DAYS POST-HATCH AND ENLARGED OTOLITH AREAS COMPARED WITH FISH FROM AMBIENT CO2 CONCENTRATIONS. MOREOVER, TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS WERE OBSERVED IN REDUCED SURVIVAL AND BODY SIZE 30 DAYS POST-HATCH AS WELL AS IN ENLARGED OTOLITHS AT THE END OF THE EXPERIMENT, WHEN FATHERS OR BOTH PARENTS WERE ACCLIMATED TO THE HIGH-CO2 ENVIRONMENT. THESE RESULTS MAY SUGGEST THAT ELEVATED CO2 CONCENTRATIONS HAD RATHER POSITIVE EFFECTS ON LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS OF THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACKS, BUT THAT PARENTAL ACCLIMATION CAN MODIFY THESE EFFECTS WITHOUT IMPROVING OFFSPRING FITNESS. ALTHOUGH THE MECHANISTIC BASIS OF SUCH TRANSGENERATIONAL ACCLIMATION REMAINS UNCLEAR, SELECTIVE GRADIENTS WITHIN GENERATIONS SEEM TO DETERMINE THE DIRECTION OF TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS. 2014 SPRINGER-VERLAG BERLIN HEIDELBERG.",NA,NA,"MBIOA","SCHADE, F.

ALTHOUGH WITHIN-GENERATION INCREASED INVESTMENT INTO IMMUNITY DEMONSTRATES CLEAR COSTS ON REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT IN A NUMBER OF TAXA, THE POTENTIAL FOR IMMUNE PRIMING TO IMPACT ON OFFSPRING REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT HAS NOT BEEN THOROUGHLY INVESTIGATED. WE EXPLORED THE REPRODUCTIVE COSTS OF IMMUNE PRIMING IN A FIELD CRICKET, TELEOGRYLLUS OCEANICUS. TO ASSESS THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL IMMUNE STATUS, MOTHERS AND FATHERS WERE IMMUNE-CHALLENGED WITH LIVE BACTERIA OR A CONTROL SOLUTION AND ASSIGNED TO ONE OF FOUR TREATMENTS IN WHICH ONE PARENT, NEITHER OR BOTH PARENTS WERE IMMUNE-CHALLENGED. FAMILIES OF OFFSPRING WERE REARED TO ADULTHOOD UNDER A FOOD-RESTRICTED DIET, AND APPROXIMATELY 10 OFFSPRING IN EACH FAMILY WERE ASSAYED FOR TWO MEASURES OF IMMUNOCOMPETENCE. WE ADDITIONALLY QUANTIFIED OFFSPRING REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT USING SPERM VIABILITY FOR MALES AND OVARY MASS FOR FEMALES. WE DEMONSTRATE THAT PARENTAL IMMUNE CHALLENGE HAS SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR THE IMMUNOCOMPETENCE AND, IN TURN, REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT OF THEIR MALE OFFSPRING. A COMPLEX INTERACTION BETWEEN MATERNAL AND PATERNAL IMMUNE STATUS INCREASED THE ANTIBACTERIAL IMMUNE RESPONSE OF MALE OFFSPRING. THIS INCREASED IMMUNE RESPONSE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A REDUCTION IN SON'S SPERM VIABILITY, IMPLICATING A TRANS-GENERATIONAL RESOURCE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN INVESTMENT INTO IMMUNOCOMPETENCE AND REPRODUCTION. OUR DATA ALSO SHOW THAT THESE COSTS ARE SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC, AS DAUGHTERS DID NOT DEMONSTRATE A SIMILAR INCREASE IN IMMUNITY, DESPITE SHOWING A REDUCTION IN OVARY MASS. 2014 EUROPEAN SOCIETY FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY.",NA,NA,"JEBIE","MCNAMARA, K.B.; CENTRE FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY, SCHOOL OF ANIMAL BIOLOGY (M092), UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA, 35 STIRLING HIGHWAY, 6009 CRAWLEY, PERTH, WA, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: KATHRYN.MCNAMARA@UWA.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.1111/jeb.12376",NA,"1010061X","JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,11,"6",NA,"1020-1028","BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD","24750259","SCOPUS","THE EFFECT OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL IMMUNE CHALLENGE ON OFFSPRING IMMUNITY AND REPRODUCTION IN A CRICKET",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901639296&doi=10.1111%2fjeb.12376&partnerID=40&md5=ff75673a4d0e8b3b131656bedeab7510","27",2014,"NA NA NA","CRAWLEY","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MCNAMARA KB, 2014, J EVOL BIOL","MCNAMARA KB, 2014, J EVOL BIOL"

ECOL.","SUMMARY: TRANSGENERATIONAL PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY IS INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT BUFFER OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE - MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT MOTHERS ALTER THE PHENOTYPE OF THEIR OFFSPRING SO AS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR PERFORMANCE IN THEIR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT. FEWER STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE CAPACITY OF PARENTS TO ALTER THE PHENOTYPE OF THEIR GAMETES TO COPE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE. IN ORGANISMS THAT SHED THEIR GAMETES EXTERNALLY, GAMETES ARE EXTREMELY VULNERABLE TO LOCAL STRESSES AND TRANSGENERATIONAL PLASTICITY IN THE PHENOTYPES OF GAMETES SEEMS LIKELY IN THIS GROUP. IN A MARINE TUBEWORM, HYDROIDES DIRAMPHUS, WE MANIPULATED THE SALINITY ENVIRONMENT THAT MOTHERS AND FATHERS EXPERIENCED BEFORE REPRODUCTION AND THEN EXAMINED THE PHENOTYPE OF THEIR GAMETES, AS WELL AS THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE GAMETES AND THE RESULTANT LARVAE IN DIFFERENT SALINITIES. WE FOUND STRONG EVIDENCE FOR GAMETE PLASTICITY - BOTH MOTHERS AND FATHERS ADAPTIVELY ADJUST THE PHENOTYPE OF THEIR GAMETES TO MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE GAMETES IN THE SALINITY REGIME EXPERIENCED BY THEIR PARENTS. PARENTS WERE QUITE FLEXIBLE IN THE PHENOTYPE OF GAMETES THAT THEY PRODUCED: THEY COULD SWITCH THE SALINITY TOLERANCE OF THEIR GAMETES BACK AND FORTH DEPENDING ON THEIR MOST RECENT EXPERIENCE. GAMETE PLASTICITY WAS NOT WITHOUT RISKS, HOWEVER. WE OBSERVED STRONG TRADE-OFFS IN PERFORMANCE WHEN GAMETES EXPERIENCED AN ENVIRONMENT THAT DID NOT MATCH THAT OF THEIR PARENTS. THESE EFFECTS OF THE PARENTAL ENVIRONMENT PERSIST FOR THE DURATION OF THE LARVAL PHASE SUCH THAT LARVAE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO DISPERSE TO ENVIRONMENTS THAT DO NOT MATCH THEIR PARENTS. GAMETE PLASTICITY MAY THEREFORE REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF PHENOTYPE-ENVIRONMENT MISMATCHES. GAMETE PLASTICITY MAY REPRESENT AN IMPORTANT MECHANISM FOR COPING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE AND AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EFFECTS IN SPECIES WITH EXTERNAL FERTILIZATION. STUDIES THAT SEEK TO PREDICT THE IMPACTS OF STRESSES THAT PERSIST ACROSS GENERATIONS (E.G.

IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND KIDNEY OF POSTNATAL DAY 50 (PND50) AND PND240 MALE OFFSPRING DERIVED FROM FATHERS EXPOSED TO SGC, SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MINERALOCORTICOID RECEPTOR (NR3C2; MR), ESTROGEN ALPHA RECEPTOR (NR3A1; ERS1), AND GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTOR (NR3C1; GR) EXPRESSION WERE OBSERVED. FURTHERMORE, SIGNIFICANT DEMETHYLATION IN REGULATORY REGIONS OF MR, GR, AND ESR1 WAS OBSERVED IN THE PND50 KIDNEY DERIVED FROM FATHERS EXPOSED TO SGC. THIS IS THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION THAT PATERNAL PHARMACOLOGICAL EXPOSURE TO SGC CAN ALTER THE EXPRESSION AND DNA METHYLATION OF NUCLEAR STEROID RECEPTORS IN BRAIN AND SOMATIC TISSUES OF OFFSPRING. THESE FINDINGS PROVIDE PROOF OF PRINCIPLE THAT ADULT MALE EXPOSURE TO SGC CAN AFFECT DNA METHYLATION AND GENE EXPRESSION IN OFFSPRING, INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY THAT ADULT EXPERIENCES THAT EVOKE INCREASES IN ENDOGENOUS GLUCOCORTICOID (I.E., STRESS) MIGHT HAVE SIMILAR EFFECTS. 2014 BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF REPRODUCTION, INC.","ARTICLE 43","CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; DEXAMETHASONE, 50-02-2; GLUCOCORTICOIDS; RECEPTORS, STEROID","BIREB","SZYF, M.; DEPARTMENT OF PHARMACOLOGY AND THERAPEUTICS, FACULTY OF MEDICINE MCGILL UNIVERSITY, 3655 PROMENADE SIR WILLIAM OSLER, MONTREAL, QC H3G 1Y6, CANADA; EMAIL: MOSHE.SZYF@MCGILL.CA","ARTICLE","10.1095/biolreprod.113.115899",NA,"00063363","BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,35,"2",NA,NA,"SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF REPRODUCTION","24451982","SCOPUS","ADULT GLUCOCORTICOID EXPOSURE LEADS TO TRANSCRIPTIONAL AND DNA METHYLATION CHANGES IN NUCLEAR STEROID RECEPTORS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND KIDNEY OF MOUSE MALE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84899935926&doi=10.1095%2fbiolreprod.113.115899&partnerID=40&md5=66f782017135734855c31af6d7caa5c8","90",2014,"NA NA NA","MCGILL UNIVERSITY;UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO;UNIVERSITY OF TORONTO;MCGILL UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;FACULTY OF MEDICINE MCGILL UNIVERSITY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"PETROPOULOS S, 2014, BIOL REPROD","PETROPOULOS S, 2014, BIOL REPROD"

NEUROSCI. RES.","PRECONCEPTION EXPOSURE TO ETOH THROUGH THE PATERNAL ROUTE MAY AFFECT NEUROBEHAVIORAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL FEATURES OF OFFSPRING. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO ETOH BEFORE CONCEPTION ON THE HYPERACTIVITY, INATTENTION, AND IMPULSIVITY BEHAVIOR OF MALE OFFSPRING IN MICE. SIRE MICE WERE TREATED WITH ETOH IN A CONCENTRATION RANGE APPROXIMATING HUMAN BINGE DRINKING (0-4 G/KG/DAY ETOH) FOR 7 WEEKS AND MATED WITH UNTREATED FEMALES MICE TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING. ETOH EXPOSURE TO SIRE MICE INDUCED ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD)-LIKE HYPERACTIVE, INATTENTIVE, AND IMPULSIVE BEHAVIORS IN OFFSPRING. AS A MECHANISTIC LINK, BOTH PROTEIN AND MRNA EXPRESSION OF DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER (DAT), A KEY DETERMINANT OF ADHD-LIKE PHENOTYPES IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS AND HUMANS, WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED BY PATERNAL ETOH EXPOSURE IN CEREBRAL CORTEX AND STRIATUM OF OFFSPRING MICE ALONG WITH INCREASED METHYLATION OF A CPG REGION OF THE DAT GENE PROMOTER. THE INCREASE IN METHYLATION OF DAT GENE PROMOTER WAS ALSO OBSERVED IN THE SPERM OF SIRE MICE, SUGGESTING GERMLINE CHANGES IN THE EPIGENETIC METHYLATION SIGNATURE OF DAT GENE BY ETOH EXPOSURE.

STERIL.","OBJECTIVE TO DETERMINE WHETHER DIETARY AND EXERCISE REGIMES IN OBESE MALES CAN PROVIDE A NOVEL INTERVENTION WINDOW FOR IMPROVING THE REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OF THE NEXT GENERATION. DESIGN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMAL STUDY. SETTING UNIVERSITY RESEARCH FACILITIES. ANIMAL(S) C57BL6 MALE AND FEMALE MICE. INTERVENTION(S) MICE WERE FED A CONTROL DIET (6% FAT) OR HIGH-FAT DIET (21% FAT) FOR 9 WEEKS. AFTER THE INITIAL FEEDING, HIGH-FAT-DIET MALES WERE ALLOCATED TO DIET AND/OR EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS FOR A FURTHER 9 WEEKS. AFTER INTERVENTION MALES WERE MATED WITH FEMALES FED STANDARD CHOW (4% FAT) BEFORE AND DURING PREGNANCY. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S) F1 SPERM MOTILITY, COUNT, MORPHOLOGY, CAPACITATION, MITOCHONDRIAL FUNCTION, AND SPERM BINDING AND WEIGHT OF REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS. RESULT(S) OUR PRIMARY FINDING WAS THAT DIET INTERVENTION ALONE IN FOUNDERS IMPROVED OFFSPRING SPERM MOTILITY AND MITOCHONDRIAL MARKERS OF SPERM HEALTH (DECREASED REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES AND MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANE POTENTIAL), ULTIMATELY IMPROVING SPERM BINDING. SPERM BINDING AND CAPACITATION WAS ALSO IMPROVED IN F1 MALES BORN TO A COMBINED DIET AND EXERCISE INTERVENTION IN FOUNDERS. FOUNDER SPERM PARAMETERS AND METABOLIC MEASURES AS A RESPONSE TO DIET AND/OR EXERCISE (I.E., LIPID/GLUCOSE HOMEOSTASIS, SPERM COUNT AND MORPHOLOGY) CORRELATED WITH OFFSPRING'S SPERM FUNCTION, INDEPENDENT OF FOUNDER TREATMENT. THIS IMPLICATES PATERNAL METABOLIC AND REPRODUCTIVE STATUS IN PREDICTING MALE OFFSPRING'S REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION. CONCLUSION(S) THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO SHOW THAT IMPROVEMENTS TO BOTH METABOLIC (LIPIDS, GLUCOSE AND INSULIN SENSITIVITY) AND REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION (SPERM MOTILITY AND MORPHOLOGY) IN OBESE FATHERS VIA DIET AND EXERCISE INTERVENTIONS CAN IMPROVE SUBSEQUENT REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN OFFSPRING. 2014 AMERICAN SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTIVE MEDICINE, PUBLISHED BY ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"CHOLESTEROL, 57-88-5; GLUCOSE, 50-99-7, 84778-64-3; INSULIN, 9004-10-8","FESTA","MCPHERSON, N.O.; DISCIPLINE OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY, SCHOOL OF PAEDIATRICS AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE, ADELAIDE, SA, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: NICOLE.MCPHERSON@ADELAIDE.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.fertnstert.2013.12.007",NA,"00150282","FERTILITY AND STERILITY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,31,"3",NA,"865-873.E1","ELSEVIER INC.","24424359","SCOPUS","OBESE FATHER'S METABOLIC STATE, ADIPOSITY, AND REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY INDICATE SON'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84894415294&doi=10.1016%2fj.fertnstert.2013.12.007&partnerID=40&md5=07a7255a837bf333f8f8bba54c3dde6b","101",2014,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MCPHERSON NO, 2014, FERTIL STERIL","MCPHERSON NO, 2014, FERTIL STERIL"

OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PATERNAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION PRIOR TO CONCEPTION REPRESENTS A POTENTIAL RISK TO FETAL AND POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT. 2013 KOREAN SOCIETY FOR INTEGRATIVE BIOLOGY.",NA,NA,NA,"KO, K.; CENTER FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH, INSTITUTE OF ADVANCED BIOMEDICAL SCIENCE, KONKUK UNIVERSITY, SEOUL 143-701, SOUTH KOREA; EMAIL: KNKO@KKU.AC.KR","ARTICLE","10.1080/19768354.2013.865675","MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGYMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,MEST,20120005133 NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREANATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREA,NRF","19768354","ANIMAL CELLS AND SYSTEMS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,8,"6",NA,"429-434",NA,NA,"SCOPUS","TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE IN MOUSE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84890902504&doi=10.1080%2f19768354.2013.865675&partnerID=40&md5=7094165126a7fc243284a5593c2e8687","17",2013,"THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY GRANT NUMBER 11182KFDA556 OF THE KOREAN FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (KFDA) 2011-15889, AND BASIC SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAM THROUGH THE NATIONAL RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF KOREA (NRF) FUNDED BY THE MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY (20120005133).

THUS, THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO ELUCIDATE WHETHER THESE ADVERSE EFFECTS ARE PASSED FROM EXPOSED MALE MICE TO THEIR OFFSPRING. ADULT MALE MICE RECEIVED FEN (10 MG/KG) DAILY FOR 30 DAYS AND MATED WITH UNTREATED FEMALES TO PRODUCE OFFSPRING. FENVALERATE SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED THE METHYLATION STATUS OF ANGIOTENSIN I-CONVERTING ENZYME (ACE), FORKHEAD BOX O3 (FOXO3A), HUNTINGTIN-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN 1 (HAP1), NUCLEAR RECEPTOR SUBFAMILY 3 (NR3C2), PROMYELOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (PML), AND PROSTAGLANDIN F2 RECEPTOR NEGATIVE REGULATOR (PTGFRN) GENES IN PATERNAL MICE SPERM GENOMIC DNA. FURTHER, FEN SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED SPERM ABNORMALITIES; SERUM TESTOSTERONE AND ESTRADIOL-17 LEVEL IN ADULT MALE (F0) AND THEIR MALE OFFSPRING (F1). FURTHER, PATERNAL FEN TREATMENT SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE LENGTH OF ESTROUS CYCLE, SERUM ESTRADIOL-17 CONCENTRATION IN ESTRUS, AND PROGESTERONE LEVELS IN DIESTRUS IN FEMALE OFFSPRING (F1).

LETT.","NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE (NAFLD) IS CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE, WHICH MAY AFFECT FERTILITY. HEREIN, WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER NAFLD IMPAIRS THE REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION OF MALE RATS. MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE FED A HIGH FAT DIET (HFD) UNTIL THEY DEVELOPED NAFLD. N-3 POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID (PUFA) WAS THEN GIVEN FOR 4 WEEKS TO PREVENT HEPATIC STEATOSIS. TESTES WEIGHT AND SERUM AND TESTICULAR TESTOSTERONE WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN RATS WITH NAFLD COMPARED WITH HEALTHY CONTROLS. TESTICULAR PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN NAFLD RATS INCLUDED MARKEDLY REDUCED SPERM NUMBER AND MOTILITY, AND THE NUMBER OF APOPTOTIC SPERMATOGENIC CELLS WAS HIGHER, WHICH WAS CONSISTENT WITH A REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF TETRAPLOID CELLS. BREEDING EXPERIMENTS INDICATED THAT PATERNAL NAFLD AFFECTED NEITHER THE SPERM MORPHOLOGY NOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF FETUSES AND OFFSPRING, BUT DID PROLONG THE DAYS REQUIRED FOR INSEMINATION. HOWEVER, ADMINISTRATION OF N-3 PUFA ALLEVIATED THE IMPAIRMENT OF REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT NAFLD IMPAIRS REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION IN MALE RATS BY DECREASING TESTICULAR TESTOSTERONE SYNTHESIS, AND N-3 PUFA TREATMENT MAY HAVE A BENEFICIAL THERAPEUTIC EFFECT. 2013 ELSEVIER IRELAND LTD.",NA,"TESTOSTERONE, 58-22-0; FATTY ACIDS, OMEGA-3; FISH OILS; TESTOSTERONE, 58-22-0; OMEGAVEN","TOLED","CHEN, D.; DEPARTMENT OF GASTROENTEROLOGY, INSTITUTE OF SURGERY RESEARCH, DAPING HOSPITAL, THIRD MILITARY MEDICAL UNIVERSITY, 10 CHANGJIANG ZHILU, DA PING, CHONGQING 400042, CHINA; EMAIL: CHENDF1981@163.COM","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.toxlet.2013.05.644","81200297,81072362 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA","03784274","TOXICOLOGY LETTERS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,22,"2",NA,"224-232",NA,"23747427","SCOPUS","IMPAIRMENT OF REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION IN A MALE RAT MODEL OF NON-ALCOHOLIC FATTY LIVER DISEASE AND BENEFICIAL EFFECT OF N-3 FATTY ACID SUPPLEMENTATION",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884167795&doi=10.1016%2fj.toxlet.2013.05.644&partnerID=40&md5=745fbe7bcb285e7ebb26420cb406737c","222",2013,"WE WOULD LIKE TO THANK JUN WANG, XIAODI CHEN, YANYAN YU, AND YA LI FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE.

THESE HAVE HITHERTO BEEN INVESTIGATED MAINLY WITH RESPECT TO SUBSTANCE-INDUCED IMPAIRMENT IN THE PROGENY. IN RECENT YEARS, EXPERIENTIAL INFLUENCES ON OFFSPRING HAVE COME INTO FOCUS THROUGH GROWING INSIGHT INTO EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS SUCH AS NONGENETIC MODES OF TRANSMISSION. THE EFFECT OF CHRONIC AND/OR EARLY MANIPULATIONS IN MALES HAS BEEN STUDIED BUT MUCH LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SINGULAR MANIPULATIONS IN OLDER INDIVIDUALS. WE INVESTIGATED THE INFLUENCE OF A STRONG STRESSOR EXPOSURE, REMINISCENT OF A TRAUMATIC EVENT, IN ADULT MALE MICE ON OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR. MALE MICE, 6 WEEKS OF AGE, RECEIVED A STRONG FOOTSHOCK AND WERE MATED TO NAVE FEMALES SEVERAL WEEKS LATER. MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING WERE INVESTIGATED IN A VARIETY OF TESTS FOR ANXIETY-LIKE AND DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIORS. IN ADDITION, BODYWEIGHT DEVELOPMENT WAS ASSESSED. ALTHOUGH WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY ALTERATIONS IN ANXIETY-LIKE AND DEPRESSIVE-LIKE BEHAVIORAL INDICES, WE RECORDED REDUCED BODYWEIGHT DEVELOPMENT IN THE FEMALE OFFSPRING.

THE PREVIOUS STUDY SHOWING A MAJOR EFFECT OF PATERNAL OBESITY ON METABOLIC HEALTH OF OFFSPRING IS CONFOUNDED BY COMORBIDITY WITH DIABETES. THEREFORE, WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECT OF DIET-INDUCED PATERNAL OBESITY, IN THE ABSENCE OF DIABETES, ON THE METABOLIC HEALTH OF TWO RESULTANT GENERATIONS AND THE MOLECULAR PROFILES OF THE TESTES AND SPERM. FOUNDER (F0) MALE C57BL6 MICE WERE FED EITHER A HIGH-FAT DIET (HFD) OR A CONTROL DIET (CD); N = 10/DIET FOR A PERIOD OF 10 WK. TESTIS EXPRESSION OF MRNA/MICRORNAS WAS ANALYZED BY MICROARRAY AND QPCR AND SPERM MICRORNA ABUNDANCE BY QPCR TWO SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS WERE GENERATED BY MATING F0 AND THEN F1 MICE TO CD MICE, AND THEIR METABOLIC HEALTH WAS INVESTIGATED. ALL MICE, OTHER THAN F0 MALES, WERE MAINTAINED ON A CD. HFD FEEDING INDUCED PATERNAL OBESITY WITH A 21% INCREASE IN ADIPOSITY, BUT NOT OVERT DIABETES, AND INITIATED INTERGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF OBESITY AND INSULIN RESISTANCE IN TWO GENERATIONS OF OFFSPRING. THIS DISTINCT PHENOTYPIC CONSTELLATION IS EITHER PARTIALLY OR FULLY TRANSMITTED TO BOTH FEMALE AND MALE F1 OFFSPRING AND FURTHER TRANSMITTED THROUGH BOTH PARENTAL LINEAGES TO THE F2 GENERATION, WITH A HEIGHTENED EFFECT ON FEMALE F1 OFFSPRING (+67% IN ADIPOSITY) AND THEIR F2 SONS (+24% IN ADIPOSITY). FOUNDER MALE OBESITY ALTERED THE TESTES EXPRESSION OF 414 MRNAS BY MICROARRAY AND 11 MICRORNAS BY QPCR, CONCOMITANT WITH ALTERATIONS IN SPERM MICRORNA CONTENT AND A 25% REDUCTION IN GLOBAL METHYLATION OF GERM CELL DNA DIET-INDUCED PATERNAL OBESITY MODULATES SPERM MICRORNA CONTENT AND GERM CELL METHYLATION STATUS, WHICH ARE POTENTIAL SIGNALS THAT PROGRAM OFFSPRING HEALTH AND INITIATE THE TRANSMISSION OF OBESITY AND IMPAIRED METABOLIC HEALTH TO FUTURE GENERATIONS. THIS STUDY IMPLICATES PATERNAL OBESITY IN THE TRANSGENERATIONAL AMPLIFICATION OF OBESITY AND TYPE 2 DIABETES IN HUMANS.

MOST EVIDENCE FOR TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS COMES FROM STUDIES OF FEMALE MAMMALS, WITH MUCH LESS KNOWN ABOUT EGG-LAYING ORGANISMS OR PATERNALLY-MEDIATED EFFECTS. HERE WE SHOW THAT OFFSPRING SEX CAN BE AFFECTED BY THE INCUBATION TEMPERATURE ITS FATHER EXPERIENCES YEARS EARLIER. WE INCUBATED EGGS OF AN AUSTRALIAN LIZARD WITH TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENT SEX DETERMINATION UNDER THREE THERMAL REGIMES; SOME EGGS WERE GIVEN AN AROMATASE INHIBITOR TO PRODUCE SONS AT TEMPERATURES THAT USUALLY PRODUCE ONLY DAUGHTERS. OFFSPRING WERE RAISED TO MATURITY AND FREELY INTERBRED WITHIN FIELD ENCLOSURES. AFTER INCUBATING EGGS OF THE SUBSEQUENT GENERATION AND ASSIGNING PARENTAGE, WE FOUND THAT THE DEVELOPMENTAL TEMPERATURE EXPERIENCED BY A MALE SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCES THE SEX OF HIS FUTURE PROGENY. THIS TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECT ON SEX RATIO MAY REFLECT AN EPIGENETIC INFLUENCE ON PATERNALLY-INHERITED DNA.

BEHAV.","BISPHENOL A (BPA) IS A UBIQUITOUS ENVIRONMENTAL ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING COMPOUND (EDC); PUBLIC HEALTH CONCERNS HAVE BEEN FUELED BY FINDINGS THAT MATERNAL BPA EXPOSURE CAN CHANGE SEX DIFFERENCES IN THE BRAIN AND IN SOME BEHAVIORS. WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER A PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT DOSE OF BPA INGESTED BY MALE RATS BEFORE CONCEPTION WOULD AFFECT SPATIAL MEMORY AND HIPPOCAMPAL ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE (ACHE) IN THEIR ADULT OFFSPRING. TWENTY-TWO 60-DAY-OLD MALE RATS (F0) RECEIVED EITHER A BPA DIET (50. G/KG/DAY) OR VEHICLE ALONE FOR 10. WEEKS BEFORE BEING MATED WITH NON-EXPOSED FEMALES. THE PATERNAL RATS AND THEIR FORTY ADULT OFFSPRING'S (F1) BEHAVIORS WERE THEN EXAMINED IN THE MORRIS WATER MAZE (MWM) AND THEIR ACHE ACTIVITIES IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS WERE EVALUATED. BPA EXPOSURE LED TO SPATIAL MEMORY DEFICITS ALONG WITH DECREASED ACHE ACTIVITIES IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS (P=0.01) IN ADULT F0 RATS. THIS PATERNAL EXPOSURE ALSO INDUCED IMPAIRMENT IN SPATIAL MEMORY ACQUISITION IN BOTH SEXES WHILE RETENTION ONLY IN FEMALES IN F1 RATS, AS WELL AS ABOLISHED SEX DIFFERENCES IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS ACHE. OVERALL, THESE DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL BPA EXPOSURE, AT A ""SAFE"" DOSE, MAY INDUCE TRANSGENERATIONAL ALTERATIONS IN SPATIAL MEMORY IN A SEX-SPECIFIC MANNER. 2013 ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"4,4' ISOPROPYLIDENEDIPHENOL, 80-05-7; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE, 9000-81-1","HOBEA","YING, C.; DEPARTMENT OF NUTRITION AND FOOD HYGIENE, SCHOOL OF PUBLIC HEALTH, TONGJI MEDICAL COLLEGE, HUAZHONG UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, WUHAN 430030, CHINA; EMAIL: YINGCJ@HUST.EDU.CN","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.08.014","NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM)NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM),CB722401 NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA,81172674,81030051","0018506X","HORMONES AND BEHAVIOR","ENGLISH",NA,NA,21,"4",NA,"598-604",NA,"24005185","SCOPUS","DOES PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO A PHYSIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT LEVEL OF BISPHENOL A ALTER SPATIAL MEMORY IN AN ADULT RAT?",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84884972759&doi=10.1016%2fj.yhbeh.2013.08.014&partnerID=40&md5=dd1ed995a0c6250ed318b28569a5d4a5","64",2013,"THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY THE NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM) 2012 CB722401 AND NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA GRANTS 81030051 AND 81172674 .

STUDIES FROM OUR LABORATORY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT TREATMENT OF ADULT MALE RATS WITH TAMOXIFEN INCREASED POSTIMPLANTATION LOSS AROUND MID GESTATION. FURTHER STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THE ABERRANT EXPRESSION OF TRANSCRIPTS OF SEVERAL IMPRINTED GENES IN THE RESORBING EMBRYOS AT DAYS 11 AND 13 OF GESTATION INCLUDING IGF2. IN ADDITION, DECREASED METHYLATION AT THE IGF2-H19 IMPRINT CONTROL REGION WAS OBSERVED IN SPERMATOZOA AND IN RESORBING EMBRYOS SIRED BY TAMOXIFEN-TREATED MALES. IN THIS STUDY, METHYLATION ANALYSIS OF THE IMPRINTED GENES, WHICH WERE FOUND TO BE DIFFERENTIALLY EXPRESSED, WAS DONE USING EPITYPER IN THE SPERMATOZOA OF TAMOXIFEN-TREATED RATS AND IN POSTIMPLANTATION EMBRYOS SIRED BY TAMOXIFEN-TREATED RATS. DIFFERENTIALLY METHYLATED REGIONS (DMRS) FOR MOST IMPRINTED GENES HAVE NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED IN THE RATS. HENCE, INITIAL EXPERIMENTS WERE PERFORMED TO IDENTIFY THE PUTATIVE DMRS IN THE GENES SELECTED FOR THE STUDY. INCREASED METHYLATION AT CPG ISLANDS PRESENT IN THE PUTATIVE DMRS OF A NUMBER OF IMPRINTED GENES WAS OBSERVED IN THE RESORBING EMBRYOS SIRED BY TAMOXIFEN-TREATED MALE RATS. THIS INCREASE IN METHYLATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DOWNREGULATION OF MOST OF THESE GENES AT THE TRANSCRIPT LEVEL IN RESORBING EMBRYOS. NO CHANGE IN THE METHYLATION STATUS OF THESE GENES WAS OBSERVED IN SPERMATOZOA. THESE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A DEREGULATION OF MECHANISMS PROTECTING UNMETHYLATED ALLELES FROM A WAVE OF DE NOVO METHYLATION OCCURS FOLLOWING IMPLANTATION. 2013 SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTION AND FERTILITY.",NA,"TAMOXIFEN, 10540-29-1; DLK1 PROTEIN, MOUSE; IGF2 PROTEIN, MOUSE; INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR II, 67763-97-7; INTERCELLULAR SIGNALING PEPTIDES AND PROTEINS; RASGRF1 PROTEIN, MOUSE; SELECTIVE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS; TAMOXIFEN, 094ZI81Y45; RAS-GRF1","RCUKB","BALASINOR, N.H.; NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY DIVISION, NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (ICMR), PAREL, MUMBAI 400 012, INDIA; EMAIL: BALASINORN@NIRRH.RES.IN","ARTICLE","10.1530/REP-12-0439",NA,"14701626","REPRODUCTION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,6,"2",NA,"155-168",NA,"23740079","SCOPUS","ABERRANT METHYLATION OF MULTIPLE IMPRINTED GENES IN EMBRYOS OF TAMOXIFEN-TREATED MALE RATS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84880552795&doi=10.1530%2fREP-12-0439&partnerID=40&md5=b43e18f8017c4549470a63f518b575f2","146",2013,"NA NA NA","NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (ICMR)","NOTREPORTED;NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (ICMR);EMAIL: BALASINORN@NIRRH.RES.IN",NA,"KEDIA-MOKASHI NA, 2013, REPRODUCTION","KEDIA-MOKASHI NA, 2013, REPRODUCTION"

TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF MYCORRHIZAL SYMBIOSIS ARE LARGELY UNKNOWN, ALTHOUGH THEORETICALLY EXPECTED. WE EXAMINED THE MATERNAL AND PATERNAL EFFECTS OF AM FUNGAL SYMBIOSIS AND HOST SEX ON SEED PRODUCTION AND POSTERIOR SEEDLING PERFORMANCE IN GERANIUM SYLVATICUM, A GYNODIOECIOUS PLANT. WE HAND-POLLINATED CLONED FEMALES AND HERMAPHRODITES IN SYMBIOSIS WITH AM FUNGI OR IN NONMYCORRHIZAL CONDITIONS AND MEASURED SEED NUMBER AND MASS, AND SEEDLING SURVIVAL AND GROWTH IN A GLASSHOUSE EXPERIMENT. FEMALES PRODUCED MORE SEEDS THAN HERMAPHRODITES, BUT THE SEEDS DID NOT GERMINATE, SURVIVE OR GROW BETTER. MYCORRHIZAL PLANTS WERE LARGER, BUT DID NOT PRODUCE MORE SEEDS THAN NONMYCORRHIZAL PLANTS. TRANSGENERATIONAL PARENTAL EFFECTS OF AM FUNGI WERE VERIFIED IN SEEDLING PERFORMANCE.

THE AIM OF THE PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF BPA ON SPERMATOGENESIS AND SEMEN QUALITY. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS OF BPA ON MOUSE SPERMATOGENESIS. CD1 MICE WERE USED IN ALL EXPERIMENTS. MICE WERE TREATED WITH DIFFERENT DOSES OF BPA (0, 20 AND 40GKG-1 DAY-1FROM POSTNATAL DAY (PND) 3 TO PND21, PND 35 OR PND49. AFTER 5 WEEKS BPA TREATMENT, OESTROGEN RECEPTOR EXPRESSION WAS INCREASED IN MOUSE TESTIS, WHEREAS THE MEIOTIC PROGRESSION OF GERM CELLS WAS SLOWED. THUS, BOTH THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF SPERMATOZOA WERE DECREASED IN 7-WEEK-OLD MICE. HOWEVER, BPA HAD NO EFFECT ON DNA METHYLATION OF IMPRINTED GENES SUCH AS IGF2, IGF2R, PEG3 AND H19, IN GERM CELLS. IN ADDITION, EXPOSURE OF MALE MICE TO BPA RESULTED IN ABNORMAL OFFSPRING THAT WERE SMALLER WITH A LOW-QUALITY PELAGE WHEN THEY WERE 35 DAYS OLD.

AS SPERMATOGENESIS IS A CONTINUOUS PROCESS, EXPERIENCES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO ALTER EPIGENETIC REGULATION IN FATHERS MAY ACTUALLY CHANGE DEVELOPMENTAL TRAJECTORIES OF OFFSPRING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL STRESS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION ON BEHAVIOUR AND THE EPIGENOME OF BOTH MALE AND FEMALE DEVELOPING RAT OFFSPRING. MALE LONG-EVANS RATS WERE STRESSED FOR 27 CONSECUTIVE DAYS AND THEN MATED WITH CONTROL FEMALE RATS. EARLY BEHAVIOUR WAS TESTED IN OFFSPRING USING THE NEGATIVE GEOTAXIS TASK AND THE OPEN FIELD. AT P21 OFFSPRING WERE SACRIFICED AND GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION LEVELS IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS AND FRONTAL CORTEX WERE ANALYSED. PATERNAL STRESS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION ALTERED BEHAVIOUR OF ALL OFFSPRING ON THE NEGATIVE GEOTAXIS TASK, DELAYING ACQUISITION OF THE TASK. IN ADDITION, MALE OFFSPRING DEMONSTRATED A REDUCTION IN STRESS REACTIVITY IN THE OPEN FIELD PARADIGM SPENDING MORE TIME THAN EXPECTED IN THE CENTRE OF THE OPEN FIELD. PATERNAL STRESS ALSO ALTERED DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS IN OFFSPRING AT P21, GLOBAL METHYLATION WAS REDUCED IN THE FRONTAL CORTEX OF FEMALE OFFSPRING, BUT INCREASED IN THE HIPPOCAMPUS OF BOTH MALE AND FEMALE OFFSPRING. THE RESULTS FROM THIS STUDY CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT PATERNAL STRESS DURING SPERMATOGENESIS CAN INFLUENCE OFFSPRING BEHAVIOUR AND DNA METHYLATION PATTERNS, AND THESE AFFECTS OCCUR IN A SEX-DEPENDENT MANNER. DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE IN THE CENTRE OF A COMPLEX INTERACTION BETWEEN MATERNAL, PATERNAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES, WHICH COMBINE TO PRODUCE THE VARIOUS PHENOTYPES AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES THAT WE PERCEIVE. 2013 IBRO.",NA,"DNA, 9007-49-2","NRSCD","MYCHASIUK, R.; CANADIAN CENTRE FOR BEHAVIOURAL NEUROSCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF LETHBRIDGE, 4401 UNIVERSITY DRIVE, LETHBRIDGE, AB, CANADA; EMAIL: R.MYCHASIUK@ULETH.CA","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.neuroscience.2013.03.025",NA,"03064522","NEUROSCIENCE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,55,NA,NA,"100-105",NA,"23531434","SCOPUS","PATERNAL STRESS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION ALTERS DNA METHYLATION AND BEHAVIOUR OF DEVELOPING RAT OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84876704706&doi=10.1016%2fj.neuroscience.2013.03.025&partnerID=40&md5=65a6ed67e38aeb6a8fb00c844e33efda","241",2013,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF LETHBRIDGE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF LETHBRIDGE;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MYCHASIUK R, 2013, NEUROSCIENCE","MYCHASIUK R, 2013, NEUROSCIENCE"

BIOL.","IN MANY SPECIES, MALES INFLUENCE PHENOTYPIC TRAITS IN THEIR OFFSPRING THROUGH NON-GENETIC PATERNAL EFFECTS. SUCH EFFECTS CAN REPRESENT A FORM OF PATERNAL INVESTMENT, AND MALES MAY BENEFIT BY ADJUSTING THE EFFECTS DEPENDING ON ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETERS, SUCH AS OPERATIONAL SEX RATIO, SO AS TO MAXIMIZE OFFSPRING FITNESS. IN THE NERIID FLY TELOSTYLINUS ANGUSTICOLLIS, FATHERS REARED ON A NUTRIENT-RICH LARVAL DIET PRODUCE LARGER OFFSPRING, INDEPENDENT OF THE REARING ENVIRONMENT OF THE OFFSPRING. HERE WE ASKED WHETHER THIS PATERNAL EFFECT WAS INFLUENCED BY THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT TO WHICH FATHERS WERE EXPOSED. WE FOUND SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS OF THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL LARVAL DIET QUALITY AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT (SAME-SEX VS. MIXED-SEX GROUPS) ON OFFSPRING FITNESS-RELATED TRAITS. FATHERS REARED ON A NUTRIENT-RICH DIET PRODUCED LARGER MALE OFFSPRING WHEN HOUSED IN MIXED-SEX GROUPS. HOWEVER, FATHERS REARED ON A NUTRIENT-RICH DIET PRODUCED MORE VIABLE OFFSPRING (OR MORE VIABLE SPERM) WHEN HOUSED IN SAME-SEX GROUPS PRIOR TO MATING. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT FITNESS-ENHANCING PATERNAL EFFECTS CAN TRADE OFF, CONSISTENT WITH PARENTAL INVESTMENT THEORY ON THE OFFSPRING SIZE-NUMBER TRADE-OFF, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THESE TRAITS REPRESENT ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT OPTIONS AND PARENTS ARE SELECTED TO OPTIMIZE THE BALANCE BASED ON A RANGE OF ENVIRONMENTAL VARIABLES. THIS IS THE FIRST STUDY TO SHOW THAT MALES CAN FACULTATIVELY MODULATE PATERNAL EFFECTS BASED ON THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT. 2012 SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA NEW YORK.",NA,NA,NA,"ADLER, M.

NEUROSCI.","NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE FREQUENTLY PRESENTS WITH AN UNDERLYING HYPOREACTIVITY OR HYPERREACTIVITY OF THE HPA STRESS AXIS, SUGGESTING AN EXCEPTIONAL VULNERABILITY OF THIS CIRCUITRY TO EXTERNAL PERTURBATIONS. PARENTAL LIFETIME EXPOSURES TO ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED OFFSPRING NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE RISK, AND LIKELY CONTRIBUTE TO STRESS DYSREGULATION. WHILE MATERNAL INFLUENCES HAVE BEEN EXTENSIVELY EXAMINED, MUCH LESS IS KNOWN REGARDING THE SPECIFIC ROLE OF PATERNAL FACTORS. TO INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL MECHANISMS BY WHICH PATERNAL STRESS MAY CONTRIBUTE TO OFFSPRING HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS DYSREGULATION, WE EXPOSED MICE TO 6 WEEKS OF CHRONIC STRESS BEFORE BREEDING. AS EPIDEMIOLOGICAL STUDIES SUPPORT VARIATION IN PATERNAL GERM CELL SUSCEPTIBILITY TO REPROGRAMMING ACROSS THE LIFESPAN, MALE STRESS EXPOSURE OCCURRED EITHER THROUGHOUT PUBERTY OR IN ADULTHOOD. REMARKABLY, OFFSPRING OF SIRES FROM BOTH PATERNAL STRESS GROUPS DISPLAYED SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED HPA STRESS AXIS RESPONSIVITY. GENE SET ENRICHMENT ANALYSES IN OFFSPRING STRESS REGULATING BRAIN REGIONS, THE PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS (PVN) AND THE BED NUCLEUS OF STRIA TERMINALIS, REVEALED GLOBAL PATTERN CHANGES IN TRANSCRIPTION SUGGESTIVE OF EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING AND CONSISTENT WITH ALTERED OFFSPRING STRESS RESPONSIVITY, INCLUDING INCREASED EXPRESSION OF GLUCOCORTICOID-RESPONSIVE GENES IN THE PVN. IN EXAMINING POTENTIAL EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS OF GERM CELL TRANSMISSION, WE FOUND ROBUST CHANGES IN SPERM MICRORNA (MIR) CONTENT, WHERE NINE SPECIFIC MIRS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN BOTH PATERNAL STRESS GROUPS. OVERALL, THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT PATERNAL EXPERIENCE ACROSS THE LIFESPAN CAN INDUCE GERM CELL EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING AND IMPACT OFFSPRING HPA STRESS AXIS REGULATION, AND MAY THEREFORE OFFER NOVEL INSIGHT INTO FACTORS INFLUENCING NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE RISK. 2013 THE AUTHORS.",NA,"CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; CITALOPRAM, 59729-33-8; MICRORNAS; SEROTONIN UPTAKE INHIBITORS","JNRSD","BALE, T.

ALSO, WE FOUND INCREASED NEONATAL ADIPOSITY AMONG THE GRANDCHILDREN OF WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN UNDERNOURISHED DURING PREGNANCY. IN THE PRESENT STUDY WE INVESTIGATED WHETHER THESE TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS HAVE LED TO ALTERED BODY COMPOSITION AND POORER HEALTH IN ADULTHOOD IN THE GRANDCHILDREN. DESIGN HISTORICAL COHORT STUDY. SETTING WEB-BASED QUESTIONNAIRE. POPULATION THE ADULT OFFSPRING (F2) OF A COHORT OF MEN AND WOMEN (F1) BORN AROUND THE TIME OF THE 1944-45 DUTCH FAMINE. METHODS WE APPROACHED THE F2 ADULTS THROUGH THEIR PARENTS. PARTICIPATING F2 ADULTS (N = 360, MEAN AGE 37 YEARS) COMPLETED AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES WEIGHT, BODY MASS INDEX (BMI), AND HEALTH IN F2 ADULTS, ACCORDING TO F1 PRENATAL FAMINE EXPOSURE. RESULTS ADULT OFFSPRING (F2) OF PRENATALLY EXPOSED F1 FATHERS HAD HIGHER WEIGHTS AND BMIS THAN OFFSPRING OF PRENATALLY UNEXPOSED F1 FATHERS (+4.9 KG, P = 0.03; +1.6 KG/M 2, P = 0.006). NO SUCH EFFECT WAS FOUND FOR THE F2 OFFSPRING OF PRENATALLY EXPOSED F1 MOTHERS. WE OBSERVED NO DIFFERENCES IN ADULT HEALTH BETWEEN THE F2 GENERATION GROUPS. CONCLUSIONS OFFSPRING OF PRENATALLY UNDERNOURISHED FATHERS, BUT NOT MOTHERS, WERE HEAVIER AND MORE OBESE THAN OFFSPRING OF FATHERS AND MOTHERS WHO HAD NOT BEEN UNDERNOURISHED PRENATALLY. WE FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF GRANDMATERNAL UNDER-NUTRITION DURING GESTATION ON THE HEALTH OF THIS RELATIVELY YOUNG GROUP, BUT THE INCREASED ADIPOSITY IN THE OFFSPRING OF PRENATALLY UNDERNOURISHED FATHERS MAY LEAD TO INCREASED CHRONIC DISEASE RATES IN THE FUTURE. 2013 THE AUTHORS BJOG AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY 2013 RCOG.",NA,NA,"BIOGF","VEENENDAAL, M.V.E.; DEPARTMENT OF CLINICAL EPIDEMIOLOGY, BIOSTATISTICS AND BIOINFORMATICS, ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTRE, UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM, PO BOX 22660, 1100 DD AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS; EMAIL: M.V.VEENENDAAL@AMC.UVA.NL","ARTICLE","10.1111/1471-0528.12136",NA,"14700328","BJOG: AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNAECOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,169,"5",NA,"548-553",NA,"23346894","SCOPUS","TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF PRENATAL EXPOSURE TO THE 1944-45 DUTCH FAMINE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84875231600&doi=10.1111%2f1471-0528.12136&partnerID=40&md5=e0f5146703fa12612297e6e4d3aa65af","120",2013,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM;UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM;UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND;UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHAMPTON","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF AMSTERDAM;NOTREPORTED",NA,"VEENENDAAL MVE, 2013, BJOG INT J OBSTET GYNAECOL","VEENENDAAL MVE, 2013, BJOG INT J OBSTET GYNAECOL"

TO APPROACH PRIMARY PREVENTION STRATEGIES FOR ALLERGY, WE INVESTIGATED TO WHAT EXTENT GENETIC, PATERNAL AND MATERNAL FACTORS INFLUENCE THIS SUPPRESSIVE EFFECT ON ALLERGIC SENSITISATION IN OFFSPRING AND INVESTIGATED THE POSSIBILITY OF PREGESTATIONAL IMMUNISATION. MATERNAL ALLERGEN IMMUNISATION REDUCED OVA-SPECIFIC IGE LEVELS IN IMMUNISED OFFSPRING, EVEN AFTER MATERNAL IMMUNISATION UP TO 8WEEKS BEFORE CONCEPTION WITHOUT FURTHER ALLERGEN EXPOSURE. IMMUNISATION OF IMMUNODEFICIENT BALB/C SEVERE COMBINED IMMUNE DEFICIENCY (SCID) DAMS MATED WITH WILD TYPE MALES DID NOT LEAD TO IGE SUPPRESSION IN OFFSPRING, INDICATING THE IMPORTANCE OF A FUNCTIONAL MATERNAL IMMUNE SYSTEM. IMMUNISATION OF MALE MICE BEFORE THE RELEVANT SPERMATOGENESIS DID NOT CAUSE ANTIBODY SUPPRESSION IN OFFSPRING. OVA-SPECIFIC IGG1, PRESUMABLY OF MATERNAL ORIGIN, WAS PRESENT IN NAVE OFFSPRING ONLY FROM IMMUNISED DAMS AND WAS ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPRESSED IGE RESPONSES AFTER OFFSPRING IMMUNISATION. THE IGE-SUPPRESSIVE EFFECT OF MATERNAL IMMUNISATION WAS DEMONSTRATED IN ALL THREE IMMUNOCOMPETENT STRAINS TESTED (NIH/OLAHSD, BALB/CA AND C57BL/6 MICE). IN CONCLUSION, SUPPRESSION OF ALLERGEN-SPECIFIC IGE PRODUCTION IN OFFSPRING COULD NOT BE INDUCED BY PATERNAL IMMUNISATION, AND GENETIC FACTORS WERE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE.

REPROD.","DURING SPERMIOGENESIS, HISTONES ARE REPLACED FIRST BY TRANSITION PROTEINS AND THEN BY PROTAMINES, RESULTING IN A VERY CONDENSED SPERM DNA STRUCTURE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR NORMAL SPERM FUNCTION. WE HAVE DEMONSTRATED PREVIOUSLY THAT, DESPITE A 9-WK RECOVERY PERIOD, MATURE SPERM FROM RATS TREATED FOR 9 WK WITH BLEOMYCIN, ETOPOSIDE, AND CIS-PLATINUM (BEP), THE DRUGS USED TO TREAT TESTICULAR CANCER, HAVE REDUCED LEVELS OF PROTAMINE 1 AND A CONCOMITANT UPREGULATION OF SPECIFIC HISTONES, HIGHLIGHTING A PROBLEM IN HISTONE EVICTION. HERE, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT REGULATORS OF HISTONE REMOVAL ARE INCREASED IN ELONGATING SPERMATIDS FOLLOWING RECOVERY; HOWEVER, AC-H4 AND GAMMAH2AX HISTONES REMAIN ELEVATED IN ELONGATING SPERMATIDS OR CAUDAL EPIDIDYMAL SPERMATOZOA 9 WK POST-BEP TREATMENT. THIS INDICATES THAT CHROMATIN REMODELERS AND EFFECTOR PROTEINS THAT RESPOND TO HISTONE REMOVAL CUES MAY BE A TARGET OF BEP TREATMENT. A DECREASE IN THE EXPRESSION OF SMARCE1 IN ELONGATING SPERMATIDS MAY EXPLAIN THE PERSISTENT RETENTION OF HISTONES IN CAUDA EPIDIDYMAL SPERM 9 WK AFTER THE CESSATION OF BEP TREATMENT. REMARKABLY, PROTEINS IMPLICATED IN THE TRANSLATIONAL CONTROL AND POSTTRANSLATIONAL PROCESSING OF PROTAMINE 1 ARE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED 9 WK POST-BEP TREATMENT, SUGGESTING THAT HISTONE EVICTION MAY DICTATE THE DNA AVAILABILITY FOR PROTAMINE BINDING. MALES MATED TO CONTROL FEMALES 9 WK AFTER BEP TREATMENT HAVE REDUCED LITTER SIZES; MOREOVER, THE PROFILE OF GENE EXPRESSION IN THE DEVELOPING TESTES OF THEIR PUPS IS ALTERED.

MALES CAN ADJUST SPERM PHENOTYPE IN RESPONSE TO LOCAL CONDITIONS, BUT THE TRANSGENERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES OF THIS PLASTICITY ARE UNKNOWN. WE MANIPULATED PATERNAL DENSITY OF A BROADCAST SPAWNER (STYELA PLICATA, A SOLITARY ASCIDEAN) USING METHODS SHOWN PREVIOUSLY TO ALTER SPERM PHENOTYPE IN THE FIELD, THEN CONDUCTED IN VITRO FERTILIZATIONS THAT EXCLUDED MATERNAL EFFECTS AND ESTIMATED OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS. OFFSPRING SIRED BY MALES FROM LOW-DENSITY EXPERIMENTAL POPULATIONS DEVELOPED FASTER AND HAD A HIGHER HATCHING SUCCESS THAN OFFSPRING SIRED BY MALES LIVING IN HIGH DENSITIES. IN THE FIELD, OFFSPRING SURVIVED RELATIVELY BETTER WHEN THEIR ENVIRONMENT MATCHED THEIR FATHER'S, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY THAT FATHERS CAN ADAPTIVELY INFLUENCE THE PHENOTYPE OF THEIR OFFSPRING ACCORDING TO LOCAL CONDITIONS. AS THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OFFSPRING IS WHETHER THEY WERE ARTIFICIALLY FERTILIZED BY SPERM FROM MALES KEPT IN HIGH- VS. LOW-DENSITY CAGES, WE CAN UNEQUIVOCALLY ATTRIBUTE ANY DIFFERENCES IN OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE TO AN ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED PATERNAL EFFECT. MALES OF MANY SPECIES MANIPULATE THE PHENOTYPE OF THEIR SPERM IN RESPONSE TO SPERM COMPETITION: OUR RESULTS SHOW THIS PLASTICITY CAN INFLUENCE OFFSPRING FITNESS, POTENTIALLY IN ADAPTIVE WAYS, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY THAT ADAPTIVE NONGENETIC PATERNAL EFFECTS MAY BE MORE COMMON THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. 2013 BY THE ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA.",NA,NA,"ECOLA",NA,"ARTICLE","10.1890/13-0184.1","AUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCILAUSTRALIAN RESEARCH COUNCIL,ARC","00129658","ECOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,54,"11",NA,"2575-2582","ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA",NA,"SCOPUS","ADAPTIVE PATERNAL EFFECTS?

RES.","MALE CONTRIBUTIONS, BOTH CHEMICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL, CAN INFLUENCE FEMALE SPERM USAGE AND REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER SUCH MALE FACTORS ARE SUBJECT TO DEPLETION IN COCCINELLA SEPTEMPUNCTATA AND COCCINELLA TRANSVERSALIS, WE TESTED THE EFFECTS OF MALE MATING HISTORY ON MALE VIRILITY, AS ESTIMATED BY MEASURES OF MATING BEHAVIOUR, FEMALE REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS AND PROGENY FITNESS, WITH PARENTAL AGE HELD CONSTANT. OVERT MEASURES OF MALE MATING EFFORT (WRIGGLING DURATION, NUMBER OF SHAKING BOUTS AND TOTAL COPULA DURATION) ALL DIMINISHED FROM VIRGIN TO 5 MATED MALES AND WERE MIRRORED BY CONCURRENT DECLINES IN FEMALE FECUNDITY AND FERTILITY (MEASURED OVER 20 DAYS). PATERNAL EFFECTS WERE ALSO OBSERVED WHICH DIMINISHED AS A FUNCTION OF MATING HISTORY, SUGGESTING THAT TRANSGENERATIONAL SIGNALS OF MALE ORIGIN ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO DEPLETION. PROGENY OF VIRGIN FATHERS HAD HIGHER RATES OF SURVIVAL (C. TRANSVERSALIS) AND FASTER DEVELOPMENT (BOTH SPECIES) THAN PROGENY OF 5 MATED FATHERS. SEMINAL FLUID PROTEINS ARE KNOWN TO HAVE ALLOHORMONAL PROPERTIES AND CAN STIMULATE FEMALE FECUNDITY AND FERTILITY IN A NUMBER OF INSECTS, MAKING THEM STRONG CANDIDATES FOR DEPLETION AS A FUNCTION OF MATING ACTIVITY. HOWEVER, IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SPERM LIMITATION AND/OR REDUCED TACTILE STIMULATION OF FEMALES BY MULTIPLE-MATED MALES MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO SOME OF THE OBSERVED EFFECTS.

WE OBSERVED DELAYED ACQUISITION AND REDUCED MAINTENANCE OF COCAINE SELF-ADMINISTRATION IN MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE, OFFSPRING OF SIRES THAT SELF-ADMINISTERED COCAINE. BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR (BDNF) MRNA AND BDNF PROTEIN WERE INCREASED IN THE MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX (MPFC), AND THERE WAS AN INCREASED ASSOCIATION OF ACETYLATED HISTONE H3 WITH BDNF PROMOTERS IN ONLY THE MALE OFFSPRING OF COCAINE-EXPERIENCED SIRES. ADMINISTRATION OF A BDNF RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST (THE TRKB RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST ANA-12) REVERSED THE DIMINISHED COCAINE SELF-ADMINISTRATION IN MALE COCAINE-SIRED RATS. IN ADDITION, THE ASSOCIATION OF ACETYLATED HISTONE H3 WITH BDNF PROMOTERS WAS INCREASED IN THE SPERM OF SIRES THAT SELF-ADMINISTERED COCAINE. COLLECTIVELY, THESE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT VOLUNTARY PATERNAL INGESTION OF COCAINE RESULTS IN EPIGENETIC REPROGRAMMING OF THE GERMLINE, HAVING PROFOUND EFFECTS ON MPFC GENE EXPRESSION AND RESISTANCE TO COCAINE REINFORCEMENT IN MALE OFFSPRING. 2013 NATURE AMERICA, INC.

THEIR EXPRESSION IS OFTEN REGULATED BY CCCTC-BINDING FACTOR (CTCF) PROTEIN BINDING AT IMPRINTING CONTROL REGIONS (ICRS). PRENATAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION IN THE DEVELOPING MOUSE FETUS. THIS STUDY EXPLORED THE EFFECT OF PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE ON DNA METHYLATION AT TWO PATERNALLY METHYLATED ICRS (H19 AND RASGRF1) IN THE SPERM OF EXPOSED MALES AND SOMATIC DNA OF SIRED OFFSPRING. SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS AT THE H19 CTCF 1 (P= 0.0027) AND CTCF 2 (P= 0.0009) BINDING SITES WERE OBSERVED IN THE OFFSPRING OF ETHANOL-TREATED SIRES, WHICH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CORRELATED WITH REDUCED WEIGHT AT POSTNATAL DAYS 35-42 (P< 0.05). AS BIRTH WEIGHT WAS UNAFFECTED AND GROWTH WAS ONLY DELAYED DURING THE POSTNATAL WEANING PERIOD, WITH SUBSEQUENT RE-CONVERGENCE, WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THIS MAY BE THE RESULT OF A MENTAL DEFICIT CAUSING DELAYED ESTABLISHMENT OF INDEPENDENT FEEDING FOLLOWING WEANING AND WOULD EXPLAIN WHY THIS EFFECT IS TRANSIENT. NO DIFFERENCE IN DNA METHYLATION WAS OBSERVED IN THE SPERM OF ALCOHOL-EXPOSED MALES, INDICATING THAT THE TRANSMISSION OF THE EPIGENETIC SIGNAL AT CONCEPTION IS NOT DUE TO ALTERED METHYLATION, BUT MAY BE THE RESULT OF AN RNA-MEDIATED MECHANISM OR ALTERED CHROMATIN REMODELING. 2012 KNEZOVICH AND RAMSAY.","ARTICLE 10",NA,NA,"RAMSAY, M.; MOLECULAR GENETICS LABORATORY, NATIONAL HEALTH LABORATORY SERVICE, DIVISION OF HUMAN GENETICS, FACULTY OF HEALTH SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND, CORNER OF HOSPITAL AND DE KORTE STREET, BRAAMFONTEIN, 2000 JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA; EMAIL: MICHELE.RAMSAY@NHLS.AC.ZA","ARTICLE","10.3389/fgene.2012.00010",NA,"16648021","FRONTIERS IN GENETICS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,61,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"SCOPUS","THE EFFECT OF PRECONCEPTION PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE ON EPIGENETIC REMODELING OF THE H19 AND RASGRF1 IMPRINTING CONTROL REGIONS IN MOUSE OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84870567826&doi=10.3389%2ffgene.2012.00010&partnerID=40&md5=80d360fd1abdc910dc2e52c34554db53","3",2012,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF THE WITWATERSRAND;NOTREPORTED",NA,"KNEZOVICH JG, 2012, FRONT GENET","KNEZOVICH JG, 2012, FRONT GENET"

ECOL.","TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF IMMUNE STIMULATION ON OFFSPRING IMMUNITY ARE WIDELY REPORTED FROM INSECTS, BUT WE KNOW VERY LITTLE OF HOW OTHER ASPECTS OF THE PARENTAL ENVIRONMENT AFFECT OFFSPRING IMMUNE REACTIVITY. WE REARED MALE AND FEMALE MOTHS PLODIA INTERPUNCTELLA ON EITHER GOOD- OR POOR-QUALITY FOOD AND THEN ALSO RAISED THEIR OFFSPRING ON ONE OF THE TWO DIET QUALITIES. WE FOUND STRONG TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS ON IMMUNITY: IN GENERAL, IF ONLY ONE PARENT RECEIVED THE POOR DIET, REDUCTIONS IN IMMUNITY WERE OBSERVED WHETHER THAT PARENT WAS THE MOTHER OR THE FATHER, AND THE LOWEST OFFSPRING IMMUNE REACTIVITY WAS OBSERVED WHEN BOTH PARENTS RECEIVED THE POOR DIET. THE MECHANISM BEHIND THESE EFFECTS IS NOT KNOWN, BUT THEY COULD BE CAUSED EITHER BY IMPRINTING, WHEREBY THE PARENT GIVES THE OFFSPRING A CUE SUCH AS AN EPIGENETIC MARK THAT CHANGES THE OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE, OR BY THE MOTHER ALLOCATING FEWER RESOURCES TO THEIR OFFSPRING WHEN THE DIET WAS POOR. TWO LINES OF EVIDENCE POINT TOWARDS IMPRINTING: THE STRONG PATERNAL EFFECTS AND THE OBSERVATION THAT THE SIZE OF THESE EFFECTS WAS EITHER UNCHANGED OR INCREASED WHEN THE OFFSPRING WERE FED A GOOD-QUALITY DIET THEMSELVES. WEIGHT WAS ALSO REDUCED WHEN EITHER PARENT WAS FED A POOR DIET, EXCEPT WHEN BOTH PARENTS HAD A POOR DIET AND THE OFFSPRING WERE RAISED ON GOOD FOOD, CONTRASTING WITH THE INCREASED RATES OF OBESITY SEEN IN VERTEBRATES WHEN EITHER PARENT IS RAISED ON A RESTRICTED DIET. OVERALL, THE EFFECTS OF PARENTAL DIET ON OFFSPRING WEIGHT AND IMMUNE REACTIVITY ARE SUBSTANTIAL AND IN SOME CASES ARE EQUIVALENT TO THAT OF THE DIET THAT THE OFFSPRING ITSELF CONSUMES. 2012 BRITISH ECOLOGICAL SOCIETY.",NA,NA,"FECOE","KNELL, R.J.; SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES, QUEEN MARY, UNIVERSITY OF LONDON, MILE END ROAD, LONDON, E14NS, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: R.KNELL@QMUL.AC.UK","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.1365-2435.2012.02051.x",NA,"02698463","FUNCTIONAL ECOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,38,"6",NA,"1409-1417",NA,NA,"SCOPUS","PARENTAL DIET HAS STRONG TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING IMMUNITY",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84869888963&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2435.2012.02051.x&partnerID=40&md5=3954fa05f18787ee804a776c32f7a7d7","26",2012,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF LONDON","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF LONDON;NOTREPORTED",NA,"TRIGGS AM, 2012, FUNCT ECOL","TRIGGS AM, 2012, FUNCT ECOL"

MOST STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON MATERNAL EFFECTS, WHEREAS FATHERS ARE ALSO LIKELY TO INFLUENCE OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE, FOR INSTANCE WHEN MALES TRANSFER NUTRIENTS TO FEMALES DURING MATING. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH THE SEPARATE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AGE AND THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED AS A SOURCE OF PARENTAL EFFECTS IN MANY SPECIES, THEIR COMBINED EFFECTS HAVE NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE ANALYZED THE COMBINED EFFECTS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL AGE AT REPRODUCTION AND A MOBILITY TREATMENT IN STRESSFUL CONDITIONS ON OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE IN THE BUTTERFLY PIERIS BRASSICAE. BOTH PATERNAL AND MATERNAL EFFECTS AFFECTED PROGENY TRAITS BUT ALWAYS VIA INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AGE AND MOBILITY TREATMENT. MOREOVER, PARENTAL EFFECTS SHIFTED FROM MALE EFFECTS EXPRESSED AT THE LARVAL STAGE TO MATERNAL EFFECTS AT THE ADULT STAGE. INDEED, EGG SURVIVAL UNTIL ADULT EMERGENCE SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED WITH FATHER AGE AT MATING ONLY FOR FATHERS HAVING EXPERIENCED THE MOBILITY TREATMENT, WHEREAS OFFSPRING ADULT LIFE SPAN DECREASED WITH INCREASING MOTHER AGE AT LAYING ONLY FOR FEMALES THAT DID NOT EXPERIENCE THE MOBILITY TREATMENT. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT BOTH PARENTS' PHENOTYPES INFLUENCE OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE THROUGH NONGENETIC EFFECTS, THEIR RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION VARYING OVER THE COURSE OF PROGENY'S LIFE. 2012 THE AUTHOR(S).

A.","PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERIENCES ARE SIGNIFICANT PREDICTORS OF DEVELOPMENTAL OUTCOMES IN OFFSPRING AND CAN OCCUR EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF PATERNAL CARE. ALTHOUGH THERE HAS BEEN A RECENT FOCUS ON THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED CHANGES IN THE MALE GERMLINE IN PRODUCING THESE EFFECTS, THE POTENTIAL MEDIATING ROLE OF MOTHERS HAS NOT BEEN INVESTIGATED. A ROLE FOR MOTHERS IN THE TRANSMISSION OF PATERNAL EFFECTS HAS BEEN WELL ACKNOWLEDGED IN BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY, WHICH PREDICTS THAT FEMALES WILL DYNAMICALLY ADJUST THEIR REPRODUCTIVE INVESTMENT IN RESPONSE TO THE QUALITIES OF THEIR MATE. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE SHOW THAT A LIFETIME OF SOCIALLY ENRICHED COMPARED WITH IMPOVERISHED HOUSING CONDITIONS SHIFTS ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR AND GENE EXPRESSION OF MALE MICE. FEMALES THAT MATE WITH ENRICHED-REARED MALES EXHIBIT INCREASED LEVELS OF PUP NURSING AND LICKING TOWARD THEIR OFFSPRING, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN GENE EXPRESSION WITHIN THE MATERNAL HYPOTHALAMUS. SIGNIFICANTLY, THESE CHANGES IN MATERNAL BEHAVIOR ARE CORRELATED WITH THE GENERAL LEVELS OF ANXIETY EXHIBITED BY THEIR MALE MATES. FURTHER, WE SHOW THAT PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT RESULTS IN INCREASED GROWTH OF THEIR OFFSPRING. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MATERNAL-PATERNAL INTERACTIONS AT MATING MAY GUIDE OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT, WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE TRANSGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL EXPERIENCES.",NA,"BRAIN DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR, 218441-99-7; CORTICOTROPIN RELEASING FACTOR, 178359-01-8, 79804-71-0, 86297-72-5, 86784-80-7, 9015-71-8; RNA, MESSENGER","PNASA","CHAMPAGNE, F.A.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGY, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, NEW YORK, NY 10027, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: FAC2105@COLUMBIA.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1073/pnas.1121083109",NA,"00278424","PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA","ENGLISH",NA,NA,69,"2",NA,"17232-17238",NA,"23045657","SCOPUS","PATERNAL SOCIAL ENRICHMENT EFFECTS ON MATERNAL BEHAVIOR AND OFFSPRING GROWTH",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84872245750&doi=10.1073%2fpnas.1121083109&partnerID=40&md5=b677054417aaca1a4001339a1910ca43","109",2012,"NA NA NA","COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY;NOTDECLARED",NA,"MASHOODH R, 2012, PROC NATL ACAD SCI U S A","MASHOODH R, 2012, PROC NATL ACAD SCI U S A"

UNDERSTANDING THE NATURE AND THE SEVERITY OF THESE EFFECTS IS IMPORTANT FOR TREATMENT OPTIMIZATION. THE AIM OF PRESENT STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE PYRAZINAMIDE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON MALE RATS DNA FRAGMENTATION, AMINO ACID COMPOSITION OF BONE TYPE I COLLAGEN, REPRODUCTIVE CAPABILITY AND THEIR POSTERITY ANTENATAL AND POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT. WISTAR ALBINO MALE RATS (160-200 G B.W.) WERE DIVIDED INTO THREE GROUPS: I - RECEIVED PYRAZINAMIDE PER OS AT A DOSE OF 1000 MG/KG B.W./DAY, II - AT A DOSE OF 2000 MG/KG B.W./DAY, IN BOTH GROUPS IT WAS GIVEN FOR 60 DAYS; III - CONTROL. AFTER 60 DAYS OF THE EXPERIMENT, RATS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL (GROUPS I AND II) AND CONTROL GROUPS WERE MATED WITH INTACT VIRGIN FEMALES. THE AMINO ACIDS CONTENTS OF MALE RAT BONE TYPE I COLLAGENS WERE DETERMINED USING AMINO ACID ANALYZER; EPIDIDYMIS AND TESTIS DNA FRAGMENTATION - ELECTROPHORETICALLY; POSTERITY ANTENATAL DEVELOPMENT INDICES AND POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT - BY STANDARD PROCEDURES. THE STUDY OF PYRAZINAMIDE EFFECTS (ADMINISTERED IN DIFFERENT DOSES) ON MALES BONE TYPE I COLLAGEN AMINO ACID CONTENTS AND TESTIS DNA FRAGMENTATION DEMONSTRATED THE PRESENCE OF DOSE-DEPENDENT PYRAZINAMIDE-MEDIATED QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN MALE RAT REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS DNA AND EXTRACELLULAR MATRIX PROTEINS IN COMPARISON WITH CONTROL. CHANGES IN NUCLEIC ACIDS AND PROTEINS STRUCTURE WERE ACCOMPANIED BY ALTERATIONS IN PROCESSES OF FERTILIZATION (WITH INTACT FEMALES), EMBRYOGENESIS AND BY LOWERING OF POSTERITY SURVIVAL.",NA,"PYRAZINAMIDE, 98-96-4; AMINO ACIDS; COLLAGEN TYPE I; PYRAZINAMIDE, 98-96-4","APPHA","BONDARENKO, L.B.; SI INSTITUTE OF PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY, NATIONALACADEMY OF MEDICAL SCIENCES OF UKRAINE, EUGENE POTIER 14, KYIV, 03680, UKRAINE; EMAIL: LARABON04@YAHOO.COM","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"00016837","ACTA POLONIAE PHARMACEUTICA - DRUG RESEARCH","ENGLISH",NA,NA,3,"5",NA,"843-850",NA,"23061279","SCOPUS","PYRAZINAMIDE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON MALE RATS DNA FRAGMENTATION, BONE TYPE I COLLAGEN AMINO ACID COMPOSITION, REPRODUCTIVE CAPABILITY AND POSTERITY ANTENATAL AND POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84865996047&partnerID=40&md5=fbea7465d479727728b444f5fe8fddae","69",2012,"NA NA NA","SI INSTITUTE OF PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY","NOTREPORTED;SI INSTITUTE OF PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BONDARENKO LB, 2012, ACTA POL PHARM DRUG RES","BONDARENKO LB, 2012, ACTA POL PHARM DRUG RES"

WE INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO BENZO[A]PYRENE (B[A]P) ON MIRNA EXPRESSION IN THE DEVELOPING MOUSE EMBRYO. MALE MICE WERE EXPOSED TO B[A]P (150MG/KG I.P.), AND THEIR SPERM WAS USED FOUR DAYS LATER IN IN-VITRO FERTILIZATION EXPERIMENTS. TWENTY EMBRYOS EACH FROM 2-, 8-CELL AND THE BLASTOCYST STAGE WERE USED FOR GENOME-WIDE MIRNA EXPRESSION PROFILING. PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO B[A]P AFFECTED THE EXPRESSION OF SEVERAL MIRNAS, AND THE TARGET GENES FOR SOME OF THE DYSREGULATED MIRNAS WERE ENRICHED IN MANY DIFFERENT PATHWAYS THAT ARE LIKELY TO BE RELEVANT FOR THE DEVELOPING MOUSE EMBRYO. BY LINKING THE MIRNA TARGET GENES TO PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATABASES, WE IDENTIFIED SOME MIRNA TARGET GENES THAT MAY SERVE AS GLOBAL MARKERS OF B[A]P-MEDIATED GENOTOXIC STRESS.

METHODS: COHORT STUDY OF ROYAL NORWEGIAN NAVY SERVICEMEN LINKED TO THE MEDICAL BIRTH REGISTRY OF NORWAY, INCLUDING SINGLETON OFFSPRING BORN BETWEEN 1967 AND 2008 (N = 37,920). EXPOSURE DURING THE LAST 3 MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION (ACUTE) AND EXPOSURE MORE THAN 3 MONTHS BEFORE CONCEPTION (NONACUTE) WERE ANALYZED. RESULTS: PERINATAL MORTALITY AND PREECLAMPSIA INCREASED AFTER SERVICE ABOARD FAST PATROL BOATS DURING AN ACUTE PERIOD AND ALSO AFTER INCREASED ESTIMATED RADIOFREQUENCY EXPOSURE DURING AN ACUTE PERIOD, COMPARED WITH SERVICE ABOARD OTHER VESSELS. NO ASSOCIATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN NONACUTE EXPOSURE AND ANY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES. CONCLUSIONS: PATERNAL WORK ABOARD FAST PATROL BOATS DURING AN ACUTE PERIOD WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PERINATAL MORTALITY AND PREECLAMPSIA, BUT THE CAUSE IS NOT CLEAR. 2012 THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE.",NA,NA,"JOEMF","BASTE, V.; OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE, UNI HEALTH, BERGEN, NORWAY; EMAIL: VALBORG.BASTE@UNI.NO","ARTICLE","10.1097/JOM.0b013e3182445003",NA,"10762752","JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICINE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,4,"4",NA,"431-438",NA,"22354128","SCOPUS","PREGNANCY OUTCOMES AFTER PATERNAL RADIOFREQUENCY FIELD EXPOSURE ABOARD FAST PATROL BOATS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84859629555&doi=10.1097%2fJOM.0b013e3182445003&partnerID=40&md5=2ba1b5860adbec1ee9eff98f95de3ce7","54",2012,"NA NA NA","UNI HEALTH;UNIVERSITY OF BERGEN;HAUKELAND UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL;HAUKELAND UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL;SR-TRNDELAG UNIVERSITY COLLEGE (HIST);DEPARTMENT OF ETIOLOGICAL RESEARCH;UME UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;UNI HEALTH;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BASTE V, 2012, J OCCUP ENVIRON MED","BASTE V, 2012, J OCCUP ENVIRON MED"

BRAIN RES.","ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT HAS BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE HEALTHY ADULT BRAIN AND AS A REMEDIAL TOOL FOR BRAINS COMPROMISED BY INJURY, DISEASE, OR NEGATIVE EXPERIENCE. BASED UPON THESE FINDINGS AND EVIDENCE FROM THE PRENATAL STRESS LITERATURE, WE VENTURED AN EXPLORATORY STUDY TO EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF PARENTAL ENRICHMENT ON OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT. USING LONG EVANS RATS, PATERNAL ENRICHMENT WAS ACHIEVED BY HOUSING SIRES IN ENRICHED ENVIRONMENTS FOR 28 DAYS PRIOR TO MATING WITH A CONTROL FEMALE. FOR THE MATERNAL ENRICHMENT PARADIGM, FEMALE RATS WERE ALSO HOUSED IN ENRICHED ENVIRONMENTS FOR 28 DAYS (7 DAYS PRIOR TO CONCEPTION AND FOR THE DURATION OF PREGNANCY). INCREASED SIZE, MULTIPLE LEVELS FOR EXPLORATION, AN ABUNDANCE OF STIMULATING TOYS, AND NUMEROUS CAGEMATES FOR SOCIAL INTERACTION WERE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE ENRICHED ENVIRONMENTS. OFFSPRING WERE ASSESSED USING TWO EARLY BEHAVIORAL TESTS AND THEN SACRIFICED AT POSTNATAL DAY 21 (P21). BRAIN TISSUE FROM THE FRONTAL CORTEX AND HIPPOCAMPUS WAS HARVESTED FOR GLOBAL DNA METHYLATION ANALYSIS. PARENTAL ENRICHMENT, PRECONCEPTIONALLY AND PRENATALLY, ALTERED OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR ON THE NEGATIVE GEOTAXIS TASK AND OPENFIELD EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR TASK. PATERNAL ENRICHMENT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED OFFSPRING BRAIN WEIGHT AT P21.

WE SET OUT TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF PARENTAL LARVAL DIET ON OFFSPRING DEVELOPMENT TIME, ADULT BODY SIZE AND ADULT RESISTANCE TO THE BACTERIUM SERRATIA MARCESCENS IN DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER. FLIES FOR THE PARENTAL GENERATION WERE RAISED ON EITHER POOR OR STANDARD DIET AND THEN MATED IN THE FOUR POSSIBLE SEX-BY-PARENTAL DIET CROSSES. FEMALES THAT WERE RAISED ON POOR FOOD PRODUCED LARGER OFFSPRING THAN FEMALES THAT WERE RAISED ON STANDARD FOOD. FURTHERMORE, MALE PROGENY SIRED BY FATHERS THAT WERE RAISED ON POOR FOOD WERE LARGER THAN MALE PROGENY SIRED BY MALES RAISED ON STANDARD FOOD. DEVELOPMENT TIMES WERE SHORTEST FOR OFFSPRING WHOSE ONE PARENT (MOTHER OR THE FATHER) WAS RAISED ON STANDARD AND THE OTHER PARENT ON POOR FOOD AND LONGEST FOR OFFSPRING WHOSE PARENTS BOTH WERE RAISED ON POOR FOOD. NO EVIDENCE FOR TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF PARENTAL DIET ON OFFSPRING DISEASE RESISTANCE WAS FOUND. ALTHOUGH PATERNAL EFFECTS HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEMONSTRATED IN D. MELANOGASTER, NO EARLIER STUDIES HAVE INVESTIGATED MALE-MEDIATED TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF DIET IN THIS SPECIES. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF NOT ONLY CONSIDERING THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION EACH PARENTAL SEX HAS ON PROGENY PERFORMANCE BUT ALSO THE COMBINED EFFECTS THAT THE TWO SEXES MAY HAVE ON OFFSPRING PERFORMANCE. 2012 VALTONEN ET AL.","E31611",NA,NA,"VALTONEN, T.

ANIM. ECOL.","1.WHEN PARASITIZED, BOTH VERTEBRATES AND INVERTEBRATES CAN ENHANCE THE IMMUNE DEFENCE OF THEIR OFFSPRING, ALTHOUGH THIS TRANSFER OF IMMUNITY IS ACHIEVED BY DIFFERENT MECHANISMS. IN SOME INSECTS, IMMUNE-CHALLENGED MALES CAN ALSO INITIATE TRANS-GENERATIONAL IMMUNE PRIMING (TGIP), BUT ITS EXPRESSIONS APPEAR QUALITATIVELY DIFFERENT FROM THE ONE INDUCED BY FEMALES SIMILARLY CHALLENGED. 2.THE EXISTENCE OF MALE TGIP CHALLENGES THE TRADITIONAL VIEW OF THE PARENTAL INVESTMENT THEORY, WHICH PREDICTS THAT FEMALES SHOULD INVEST MORE INTO THEIR PROGENY THAN MALES. HOWEVER, SEXUAL DIMORPHISM IN LIFE-HISTORY STRATEGIES AND THE POTENTIAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH TGIP MAY NEVERTHELESS LEAD TO DISSYMMETRIC INVESTMENT BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES INTO THE IMMUNE PROTECTION OF THE OFFSPRING. 3.USING THE YELLOW MEALWORM BEETLE, TENEBRIO MOLITOR, WE SHOW THAT AFTER PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO A BACTERIAL-LIKE INFECTION, MATERNAL AND PATERNAL TGIP ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENHANCEMENT OF DIFFERENT IMMUNE EFFECTORS AND DIFFERENT FITNESS COSTS IN THE OFFSPRING. WHILE ALL THE OFFSPRING PRODUCED BY CHALLENGED MOTHERS HAD ENHANCED IMMUNE DEFENCE, ONLY THOSE FROM EARLY REPRODUCTIVE EPISODES WERE IMMUNE PRIMED BY CHALLENGED FATHERS. 4.DESPITE THE FACT THAT MALES AND FEMALES MAY SHARE A COMMON INTEREST IN PROVIDING THEIR OFFSPRING WITH AN IMMUNE PROTECTION FROM THE CURRENT PATHOGENIC THREAT, THEY SEEM TO HAVE EVOLVED DIFFERENT STRATEGIES CONCERNING THIS INVESTMENT. 2011 THE AUTHORS.

FURTHER, THESE OUTCOMES CAN PERSIST INTO SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS, RAISING THE POSSIBILITY THAT ASPECTS OF HERITABILITY IN THESE DISEASES INVOLVE EPIGENETIC MECHANISMS. UTILIZING A MOUSE MODEL IN WHICH WE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED A PERIOD IN EARLY GESTATION WHEN STRESS RESULTS IN DYSMASCULINIZED AND STRESS-SENSITIVE MALE OFFSPRING, WE HAVE EXAMINED PROGRAMMING EFFECTS IN SECOND-GENERATION OFFSPRING OF PRENATALLY STRESSED (F2-S) OR CONTROL (F2-C) SIRES. EXAMINATION OF GENE EXPRESSION PATTERNS DURING THE PERINATAL SENSITIVE PERIOD, WHEN ORGANIZATIONAL GONADAL HORMONES ESTABLISH THE SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC BRAIN, CONFIRMED DYSMASCULINIZATION IN F2-S MALES, WHERE GENES IMPORTANT IN NEURODEVELOPMENT SHOWED A FEMALE-LIKE PATTERN. ANALYSES OF THE EPIGENOMIC MIRNA ENVIRONMENT DETECTED SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN MIR-322, MIR-574, AND MIR-873 IN THE F2-S MALE BRAIN, LEVELS THAT WERE AGAIN MORE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF CONTROL FEMALES. INCREASED EXPRESSION OF A COMMON GENE TARGET FOR THESE THREE MIRNAS,-GLYCAN, WAS CONFIRMED IN THESE MALES. THESE DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSMISSION OF A STRESS-SENSITIVE PHENOTYPE AND SHORTENED ANOGENITAL DISTANCE IN ADULT F2-S MALES. AS CONFIRMATION THAT THE MIRNA ENVIRONMENT IS RESPONSIVE TO ORGANIZATIONAL TESTOSTERONE, NEONATAL MALES ADMINISTERED THE AROMATASE INHIBITOR FORMESTANE EXHIBITED DRAMATIC CHANGES IN BRAIN MIRNA PATTERNS, SUGGESTING THAT MIRNAS MAY SERVE A PREVIOUSLY UNAPPRECIATED ROLE IN ORGANIZING THE SEXUALLY DIMORPHIC BRAIN. OVERALL, THESE DATA SUPPORT THE EXISTENCE OF A SENSITIVE PERIOD OF EARLY GESTATION WHEN EPIGENETIC PROGRAMMING OF THE MALE GERMLINE CAN OCCUR, PERMITTING TRANSMISSION OF SPECIFIC PHENOTYPES INTO SUBSEQUENT GENERATIONS. 2011 THE AUTHORS.",NA,"FORMESTANE, 566-48-3; TESTOSTERONE, 58-22-0","JNRSD","BALE, T.

RISK OF PTB WAS COINCIDENT WITH DECREASED PLACENTAL PROGESTERONE RECEPTOR (PGR) MRNA EXPRESSION AND INCREASED TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4 (TLR4) MRNA EXPRESSION, SUGGESTING THAT TOXICANT EXPOSURE INDUCED A HEIGHTENED INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AT THE MATERNAL-FETAL INTERFACE. SINCE OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS EXHIBIT ANTI-INFLAMMATORY ACTIVITY, IN THIS STUDY, WE PROVIDED TCDD-EXPOSED MALES A FISH OIL-ENRICHED DIET PRIOR TO MATING. ALTHOUGH PTB WAS COMMON IN CONTROL FEMALES MATED TO TCDD-EXPOSED MALES ON THE STANDARD DIET, FISH OIL SUPPLEMENTATION OF TCDD-EXPOSED MALES ELIMINATED PTB IN UNEXPOSED PARTNERS. WE ALSO DETERMINED THE INFLUENCE OF PRECONCEPTION, PATERNAL FISH OIL SUPPLEMENTATION ON THE PLACENTAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE IN LATE PREGNANCY (E18.5) BY EXAMINING THE EXPRESSION OF PGR AND TLR4 MRNA AS WELL AS THE EXPRESSION OF 15-HYDROXYPROSTAGLANDIN DEHYDROGENASE (PGDH). PGDH CATABOLIZES THE INFLAMMATORY PGE2 TO AN INACTIVE FORM; THUS, REDUCED EXPRESSION OF THIS ENZYME WOULD PROMOTE TISSUE INFLAMMATION. COMPARED WITH CONTROL PREGNANCIES, EXAMINATION OF E18.5 PLACENTAS ARISING FROM TCDD-EXPOSED MALES ON THE STANDARD DIET REVEALED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN TLR4 MRNA EXPRESSION CORRESPONDING TO A REDUCTION IN PGR MRNA AND PGDH PROTEIN EXPRESSION. IN CONTRAST, FISH OIL SUPPLEMENTATION OF TOXICANT-EXPOSED MALES LED TO NORMALIZATION OF PLACENTAL EXPRESSION OF BOTH PGR AND TLR4 MRNA AND A MARKED INCREASE IN PGDH EXPRESSION. THESE STUDIES SUGGEST THAT A PATERNAL PRECONCEPTION DIET THAT INCLUDES OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS PREVENTS THE TOXICANT-ASSOCIATED INCREASE IN THE PLACENTAL INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE AT LATE GESTATION, PREVENTING PTB. 2011 SOCIETY FOR REPRODUCTION AND FERTILITY.",NA,"15 HYDROXYPROSTAGLANDIN DEHYDROGENASE, 9030-87-9; 2,3,7,8 TETRACHLORODIBENZO PARA DIOXIN, 1746-01-6; FISH OIL, 8016-13-5; TOLL LIKE RECEPTOR 4, 203811-83-0; 15-HYDROXYPROSTAGLANDIN DEHYDROGENASE, 1.1.1.141; ANTI-INFLAMMATORY AGENTS, NON-STEROIDAL; ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS; FATTY ACIDS, OMEGA-3; FISH OILS; HYDROXYPROSTAGLANDIN DEHYDROGENASES, 1.1.1.-; PREGNANCY PROTEINS; RNA, MESSENGER; RECEPTORS, PROGESTERONE; TETRACHLORODIBENZODIOXIN, 1746-01-6; TLR4 PROTEIN, MOUSE; TOLL-LIKE RECEPTOR 4","RCUKB","BRUNER-TRAN, K.L.; WOMEN'S REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH RESEARCH CENTER, VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, NASHVILLE, TN 37232, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: KAYLON.BRUNER-TRAN@VANDERBILT.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1530/REP-11-0070",NA,"14701626","REPRODUCTION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,9,"2",NA,"235-241",NA,"21653731","SCOPUS","PRECONCEPTION OMEGA-3 FATTY ACID SUPPLEMENTATION OF ADULT MALE MICE WITH A HISTORY OF DEVELOPMENTAL 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN EXPOSURE PREVENTS PRETERM BIRTH IN UNEXPOSED FEMALE PARTNERS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79960652228&doi=10.1530%2fREP-11-0070&partnerID=40&md5=45332527c71fd0908e1834af4633bb50","142",2011,"NA NA NA","VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE;VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE;TEXAS A AND M UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF MEDICINE;NOTREPORTED",NA,"MCCONAHA ME, 2011, REPRODUCTION","MCCONAHA ME, 2011, REPRODUCTION"

THIS RAISES A POSSIBILITY THAT SUCH STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE GENOME AND ITS SUBSEQUENT EPIGENETIC MODIFICATIONS MAY ALSO TAKE PLACE DURING MAMMALIAN ONTOGENY, A PROCESS UNDERGOING FINELY ORCHESTRATED CELL DIVISION AND DIFFERENTIATION. WE TESTED THIS HYPOTHESIS BY COMPARING SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM-DEFINED HAPLOTYPE FREQUENCIES AND DNA METHYLATION OF THE RDNA MULTICOPY GENE BETWEEN TWO MOUSE ONTOGENIC STAGES AND AMONG THREE ADULT TISSUES OF INDIVIDUAL MICE. POSSIBLE INFLUENCES TO THE GENETIC AND EPIGENETIC DYNAMICS BY PATERNAL EXPOSURES WERE ALSO EXAMINED FOR CR(III) AND ACID SALINE EXTRINSIC FACTORS. VARIABLES DERIVED FROM LITTERS, INDIVIDUALS, AND DUPLICATE ASSAYS IN LARGE MOUSE POPULATIONS WERE EXAMINED USING LINEAR MIXED-EFFECTS MODEL. WE REPORT HERE THAT ACTIVE RDNA REARRANGEMENT, REPRESENTED BY CHANGES OF HAPLOTYPE FREQUENCIES, ARISES DURING ONTOGENIC PROGRESSION FROM DAY 8 EMBRYOS TO 6-WEEK ADULT MICE AS WELL AS IN DIFFERENT TISSUE LINEAGES AND IS MODIFIABLE BY PATERNAL EXPOSURES. THE RDNA METHYLATION LEVELS WERE ALSO ALTERED IN CONCORDANCE WITH THIS ONTOGENIC PROGRESSION AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH RDNA HAPLOTYPES.

IN THIS STUDY, WE EXAMINED THE EFFECT OF PATERNAL REPRODUCTIVE TACTIC ON JUVENILE BEHAVIOUR AND KIN DISCRIMINATION IN CHINOOK SALMON. WE CREATED MATERNAL HALF-SIBLING FAMILIES BY COLLECTING EGGS FROM MATURE FEMALES AND FERTILIZING ONE-HALF WITH THE MILT OF A PRECOCIOUS 2-YR-OLD MALE AND THE OTHER HALF WITH THE MILT OF A NON-PRECOCIOUS 4-YR-OLD MALE. THESE FAMILIES WERE REARED IN FULL-SIBLING GROUPS FOR APPROXIMATELY 9MO, AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WERE THEN OBSERVED IN GROUPS OF SIX FISH OF MIXED RELATEDNESS. WE FOUND EVIDENCE FOR KIN DISCRIMINATION, AS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS AGGRESSION WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS RELATED FISH THAN UNRELATED FISH, AND THE SAME TRENDS WERE OBSERVED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SOCIAL INTERACTIONS INCLUDED FULL-SIBLINGS OR HALF-SIBLINGS. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT FAMILIARITY IS NOT REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE KIN AND THEREBY IMPLICATE PHENOTYPE MATCHING AS THE MECHANISM OF KIN RECOGNITION. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THE OFFSPRING OF 2-YR-OLD MALES WERE LARGER AND MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE OFFSPRING OF 4-YR-OLD MALES, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER STUDIES SHOWING THAT PRECOCIOUS MALES ARE THE FASTEST-GROWING MEMBERS OF THEIR COHORT. HOWEVER, KIN-DIRECTED BEHAVIOURS DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE OFFSPRING OF 2- AND 4-YR-OLD MALES. 2011 BLACKWELL VERLAG GMBH.",NA,NA,"ETHOE","NEFF, B.D.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO, 1151 RICHMOND STREET, LONDON, ON, N6A 5B7, CANADA; EMAIL: BNEFF@UWO.CA","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.1439-0310.2011.01894.x",NA,"01791613","ETHOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,2,"5",NA,"451-458",NA,NA,"SCOPUS","EFFECTS OF PATERNAL REPRODUCTIVE TACTIC ON JUVENILE BEHAVIOUR AND KIN RECOGNITION IN CHINOOK SALMON (ONCORHYNCHUS TSHAWYTSCHA)",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-79953694789&doi=10.1111%2fj.1439-0310.2011.01894.x&partnerID=40&md5=60aa8e9f7852ba5a91e952675d51efad","117",2011,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF WESTERN ONTARIO;NOTREPORTED",NA,"HENKEL AJ, 2011, ETHOLOGY","HENKEL AJ, 2011, ETHOLOGY"

PATERNAL PHENOTYPE, MATERNAL, AND OFFSPRING ENVIRONMENT MAY CRUCIALLY INFLUENCE THESE TRAITS, BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE, THEIR COMBINED EFFECTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN TESTED. HERE, I FOUND THAT IN BULB MITES (RHIZOGLYPHUS ROBINI), MATERNAL NUTRITION, OFFSPRING NUTRITION, AND PATERNAL PHENOTYPE (MALES ARE FIGHTERS, ABLE TO KILL OTHER MITES, OR BENIGN SCRAMBLERS) INTERACTIVELY AFFECTED OFFSPRING AGE AND SIZE AT MATURITY. THE LARGEST EFFECT OCCURRED WHEN BOTH MATERNAL AND OFFSPRING NUTRITION WAS POOR: IN THAT CASE OFFSPRING FROM FIGHTER SIRES REQUIRED A SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER DEVELOPMENT TIME THAN OFFSPRING FROM SCRAMBLER SIRES. INVESTIGATING PARENTAL EFFECTS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AGE AND SIZE AT MATURITY REVEALED NO PATERNAL EFFECTS, AND ONLY FOR FEMALES WAS ITS SHAPE INFLUENCED BY MATERNAL NUTRITION. OVERALL, THIS REACTION NORM WAS NONLINEAR.

STUDIES FROM OUR LABORATORY HAVE DEMONSTRATED THAT TREATMENT OF ADULT MALE RATS WITH TAMOXIFEN INCREASED POST-IMPLANTATION LOSS AT AROUND MIDGESTATION. EXPRESSION OF INSULIN LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 2 (IGF2), A PATERNALLY EXPRESSED IMPRINTED GENE WAS DOWN-REGULATED IN THE RESORBING EMBRYOS OBTAINED AT EMBRYONIC DAY 13. HYPOMETHYLATION OF IGF2-H19 IMPRINT CONTROL REGION WAS OBSERVED IN THE RESORBING EMBRYO SIRES AND SPERMATOZOA OBTAINED FROM TAMOXIFEN-TREATED RATS THEREBY SUGGESTING THAT ERRORS IN IMPRINT ACQUISITION DURING SPERMATOGENESIS CAN RESULT IN EMBRYO LOSS. THE PRESENT STUDY AIMS AT STUDYING THE EXPRESSION OF OTHER IMPRINTED GENES, BESIDES IGF2 IN THE EMBRYOS SIRED BY TAMOXIFEN-TREATED MALES. MAIN METHODS: GENE EXPRESSION PROFILES OF RESORBING VERSUS NORMAL EMBRYOS WERE ASSESSED BY MICROARRAYS. REAL TIME QUANTITATIVE RT-PCR FOR SIX IMPRINTED GENES AND FOUR GENES INVOLVED IN CELL CYCLE WAS DONE TO VALIDATE GENE EXPRESSION DATA. THE AFFECTED PATHWAYS AND FUNCTIONS WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE RESORBING EMBRYOS AND EFFECT ON CELL CYCLE WAS CONFIRMED BY FLOW CYTOMETRY. KEY FINDINGS: ABERRANT EXPRESSION OF A NUMBER OF IMPRINTED GENES WAS OBSERVED IN THE RESORBING EMBRYOS WHEN COMPARED TO THE NORMAL EMBRYOS AT EMBRYONIC DAYS 11 AND 13. DOWN-REGULATION OF NOTCH SIGNALING, WNT SIGNALING AND CELL CYCLE PATHWAY WAS OBSERVED IN THE RESORBING EMBRYOS. SIGNIFICANCE: THE STUDY SUGGESTS THAT EXPOSURE OF MALE GERM CELLS TO TAMOXIFEN DURING ADULTHOOD RESULTS IN ABERRANT EXPRESSION OF IMPRINTED GENES AND DOWN-REGULATION OF DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATED PATHWAYS IN THE F 1 PROGENY THEREBY CAUSING EMBRYO LOSS. 2011 ELSEVIER INC.",NA,"SOMATOMEDIN B, 63774-77-6, 67763-97-7; SOMATOMEDIN C, 67763-96-6; SOMATOMEDIN BINDING PROTEIN 4, 136653-35-5; SOMATOMEDIN BINDING PROTEIN 5, 138636-23-4; TAMOXIFEN CITRATE, 54965-24-1; SELECTIVE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS; TAMOXIFEN, 10540-29-1","LIFSA","BALASINOR, N.

MALE MICE WERE EXPOSED TO EITHER 500 MG/KG OR 2 000 MG/KG OF DBP FOR 8 WEEKS, AND MATED WITH NON-EXPOSED FEMALES. THREE-QUARTERS OF THE FEMALES WERE SACRIFICED A DAY PRIOR TO PARTURITION, AND EXAMINED FOR THE NUMBER OF LIVING AND DEAD IMPLANTATIONS, AND INCIDENCE OF GROSS MALFORMATIONS. PUPS FROM THE REMAINING FEMALES WERE ASSESSED FOR DEVELOPMENTAL MARKERS, GROWTH PARAMETERS, AS WELL AS SPERM QUANTITY AND QUALITY. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE FERTILITY OF PARENTS AND IN INTRAUTERINE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFSPRING. PUPS OF DBP-EXPOSED MALES DEMONSTRATED GROWTH-RETARDATION. FOLLOWING PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO 500 MG/KG BW OF DBP, THERE WERE ALMOST TWICE THE NUMBER OF MALES THAN FEMALES BORN IN THE F1 GENERATION. F1 GENERATION FEMALES HAD A 2.5-DAY DELAY IN VAGINAL OPENING. PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO 2 000 MG/KG BW OF DBP INCREASED THE INCIDENCE OF SPERM HEAD MALFORMATIONS IN F1 GENERATION MALES; HOWEVER, THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN THE FERTILITY AND VIABILITY OF FOETUSES IN THE F2 GENERATION. PATERNAL DBP EXPOSURE MAY DISTURB THE SEX RATIO OF THE OFFSPRING, DELAY FEMALE SEXUAL MATURATION, AND DETERIORATE THE SPERM QUALITY OF F1 GENERATION MALES. 2011 THE EDITORIAL BOARD OF BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES.",NA,NA,NA,"DOBRZYSKA, M.M.; DEPARTMENT OF RADIATION PROTECTION AND RADIOBIOLOGY, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HYGIENE, 00-791 WARSAW, POLAND; EMAIL: MDOBRZYNSKA@PZH.GOV.P","ARTICLE","10.3967/0895-3988.2011.05.017",NA,"08953988","BIOMEDICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES","ENGLISH",NA,NA,19,"5",NA,"569-578","ELSEVIER LTD",NA,"SCOPUS","DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY IN MICE FOLLOWING PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO DI-N-BUTYL-PHTHALATE (DBP)",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81755176498&doi=10.3967%2f0895-3988.2011.05.017&partnerID=40&md5=f87aa6c63c60044b9a64775d5c8cff4a","24",2011,"NA NA NA","NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH","NOTREPORTED;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF PUBLIC HEALTH;NOTREPORTED",NA,"DOBRZYSKA MM, 2011, BIOMED ENVIRON SCI","DOBRZYSKA MM, 2011, BIOMED ENVIRON SCI"

RES. GENET. TOXICOL. ENVIRON. MUTAGEN.","TAMOXIFEN IS A SYNTHETIC NON-STEROIDAL SELECTIVE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATOR USED IN THE TREATMENT OF BREAST CANCER AND IN TREATMENT OF MALE FERTILITY. EARLIER STUDIES FROM OUR LABORATORY HAD DEMONSTRATED AN INCREASE IN POST-IMPLANTATION EMBRYO LOSS FOLLOWING TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT TO ADULT MALE RATS AT A DOSE OF 0.4MG/KG/DAY FOR 60 DAYS. THE POST-IMPLANTATION LOSS OCCURRED AT AROUND 9-10 DAYS OF GESTATION SUGGESTING THAT PATERNAL FACTORS INVOLVED IN EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT WERE AFFECTED BY TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT. THE PRESENT STUDY WAS DONE TO DETERMINE IF ANY CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATIONS OCCURRED IN THE EMBRYOS SIRED BY TAMOXIFEN TREATED MALE RATS. CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATIONS INDUCED BY TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT TO ADULT MALE RATS IN THE BONE MARROW (F 0 MALES) AND IN THE EMBRYOS SIRED BY THESE MALES (F 1 PROGENY) WERE DETERMINED. IN ADDITION, THE REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE OF THE F 1 PROGENY WAS ASSESSED. A SIGNIFICANT DOSE DEPENDENT REDUCTION IN MITOTIC ACTIVITY IN THE BONE MARROW AND EMBRYONIC CELLS WAS OBSERVED AFTER TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT. IN ADDITION, TAMOXIFEN ALSO INDUCED A SIGNIFICANT DOSE DEPENDENT INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATIONS, MAINLY GAPS AND BREAKS IN BONE MARROW AND EMBRYONIC CELLS. HOWEVER, THE EMBRYOS SIRED BY THE TAMOXIFEN TREATED MALES HAD NO EFFECT ON DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES ACHIEVED AND ON THEIR REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE. THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATIONS OBSERVED IN THE EMBRYOS DID NOT THE AFFECT THEIR DEVELOPMENT UNTIL ADULTHOOD BUT COULD MAKE THE PROGENY OF THE TAMOXIFEN TREATED MALES VULNERABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ADULT ONSET DISEASES LATER IN LIFE. 2010 ELSEVIER B.V.",NA,"TAMOXIFEN, 10540-29-1; ESTROGEN ANTAGONISTS; TAMOXIFEN, 10540-29-1","MRGMF","BALASINOR, N.H.; DIVISION OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY, NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (ICMR), PAREL, MUMBAI 400012, INDIA; EMAIL: BALASINORN@NIRRH.RES.IN","ARTICLE","10.1016/j.mrgentox.2010.08.016","NATIONAL HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTESNATIONAL HEALTH RESEARCH INSTITUTES","13835718","MUTATION RESEARCH - GENETIC TOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL MUTAGENESIS","ENGLISH","HETERO DRUGS, INDIA",NA,4,"2",NA,"169-173",NA,"20801230","SCOPUS","CHROMOSOMAL ABERRATION IN THE POST-IMPLANTATION EMBRYOS SIRED BY TAMOXIFEN TREATED MALE RATS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-78549273318&doi=10.1016%2fj.mrgentox.2010.08.016&partnerID=40&md5=08fd08b7cb2ffdebd3e725ae23aac33f","703",2010,"THE PRESENT WORK (NIRRH/MS/12/10) WAS FUNDED BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH, INDIA .

LIKEWISE, SOCIAL INSECT MOTHERS TRANSFER IMMUNITY DESPITE THE FACT THAT INVERTEBRATES LACK ANTIBODIES. 2. FEMALE TRANS-GENERATIONAL IMMUNE PRIMING IS CONSISTENT WITH PARENTAL INVESTMENT THEORY, BECAUSE MOTHERS INVEST MORE INTO REARING THEIR OFFSPRING THAN FATHERS. HOWEVER, WHEN IMMUNE PRIMING IS NOT DIRECTLY LINKED TO PARENTAL CARE, AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN INSECTS THAT ABANDON THEIR EGGS AFTER OVIPOSITION, BOTH SEXES MIGHT BENEFIT FROM PROTECTING THEIR OFFSPRING. 3. USING THE RED FLOUR BEETLE, TRIBOLIUM CASTANEUM, WE SHOW THAT AFTER PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO HEAT KILLED BACTERIA, TRANS-GENERATIONAL IMMUNE PRIMING OCCURS THROUGH FATHERS AS WELL AS MOTHERS. 4.

IN ORDER TO ESTABLISH CAUSALITY, THIS STUDY USED AN ANIMAL MODEL TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF ADVANCED PATERNAL AGE ON BEHAVIOURAL DEFICITS IN THE OFFSPRING. METHODS: C57BL/6J OFFSPRING (N=12 PER GROUP) WERE BRED FROM FATHERS OF TWO DIFFERENT AGES, 2 MONTHS (YOUNG) AND 10 MONTHS (OLD), AND MOTHERS AGED 2 MONTHS (N= 6 BREEDING PAIRS PER GROUP). SOCIAL AND EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS WERE EXAMINED IN THE OFFSPRING. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: THE OFFSPRING OF OLDER FATHERS WERE FOUND TO ENGAGE IN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SOCIAL (P=0.02) AND EXPLORATORY (P= 0.02) BEHAVIORS THAN THE OFFSPRING OF YOUNGER FATHERS. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MEASURES OF MOTOR ACTIVITY. CONCLUSIONS: GIVEN THE WELL-CONTROLLED NATURE OF THIS STUDY, THIS PROVIDES THE STRONGEST EVIDENCE FOR DELETERIOUS EFFECTS OF ADVANCING PATERNAL AGE ON SOCIAL AND EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR. DE-NOVO CHROMOSOMAL CHANGES AND/OR INHERITED EPIGENETIC CHANGES ARE THE MOST PLAUSIBLE EXPLANATORY FACTORS. 2009 SMITH ET AL.","E8456",NA,NA,"FERNANDES, C.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY, KING'S COLLEGE LONDON, LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM; EMAIL: CATHY.FERNANDES@KCL.AC.UK","ARTICLE","10.1371/journal.pone.0008456",NA,"19326203","PLOS ONE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,48,"12",NA,NA,NA,"20041141","SCOPUS","ADVANCING PATERNAL AGE IS ASSOCIATED WITH DEFICITS IN SOCIAL AND EXPLORATORY BEHAVIORS IN THE OFFSPRING: A MOUSE MODEL",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-77949537571&doi=10.1371%2fjournal.pone.0008456&partnerID=40&md5=c6a449e4eeead0ddac05bd27f89a5599","4",2009,"NA NA NA","KING'S COLLEGE LONDON;KING'S COLLEGE LONDON;MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE;MOUNT SINAI SCHOOL OF MEDICINE","NOTREPORTED;KING'S COLLEGE LONDON;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SMITH RG, 2009, PLOS ONE","SMITH RG, 2009, PLOS ONE"

THE SCROTUMS OF ANIMALS WERE IMMERSED IN WATER AT EITHER 43 C (HEAT GROUP) OR 23 C (CONTROL GROUP). HALF OF THE HEAT AND CONTROL MICE WERE GIVEN 10 MG KG-1 ZINC EVERY OTHER DAY FOR 60 DAYS AND THE OTHERS RECEIVED STERILE SALINE INSTEAD OF ZINC. HEAT STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SPERM MOTILITY, CONCENTRATION, HYPOOSMOTIC SWELLING-WATER TEST (HOS-WT) POSITIVE AND CHROMOMYCIN A3 (CMA3) NEGATIVE SPERMATOZOA AT THE FIRST 15 DAYS, AND THE GREATEST DECREASE OCCURRED AT 30 DAYS (P &LT; 0.05). SPERM MOTILITY, CONCENTRATION AND HOS-WT POSITIVE SPERMATOZOA WERE ALSO REDUCED INITIALLY IN THE ZINC ADMINISTERED GROUP, BUT WE DID NOT OBSERVE ANY FURTHER DECREASE IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED PARAMETERS ON DAY 30 (P &LT; 0.05). THE WEIGHT OF FOETUSES OBTAINED FROM THE FEMALES MATED WITH PATERNAL HEAT TREATMENT MALES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN THAT OF THE CONTROL GROUP (P &LT; 0.05) AND LONG-TERM ZINC THERAPY CAUSED A PARTIAL RECOVERY (P &GT; 0.05). THIS STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT THE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF HYPERTHERMIA ON SEMEN PARAMETERS MAY BE PREVENTED BY ZINC THERAPY. LIKEWISE, LONG-TERM ADMINISTRATION OF ZINC COULD IMPROVE QUALITY OF LITTER OBTAINED FROM THE FEMALES MATED WITH SCROTAL HEAT TREATMENT MALES. 2009 BLACKWELL VERLAG GMBH.",NA,"CHROMOMYCIN A3, 7059-24-7; ZINC, 7440-66-6; PROTAMINES; ZINC SULFATE, 7733-02-0","ANDRD","BABAEI, H.; DEPARTMENT OF CLINICAL SCIENCES, FACULTY OF VETERINARY MEDICINE, SHAHID BAHONAR UNIVERSITY OF KERMAN, PO BOX 7617614111, KERMAN, IRAN; EMAIL: BABAEI_H@MAIL.UK.AC.IR","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.1439-0272.2009.00920.x",NA,"03034569","ANDROLOGIA","ENGLISH","SIGMA ALDRICH, UNITED STATES",NA,16,"4",NA,"222-228",NA,"19601933","SCOPUS","EFFECT OF LONG-TERM ADMINISTRATION OF ZINC AFTER SCROTAL HEATING ON MICE SPERMATOZOA AND SUBSEQUENT OFFSPRING QUALITY",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-67650745218&doi=10.1111%2fj.1439-0272.2009.00920.x&partnerID=40&md5=7cc899b42ad571c33c55c39bd90356a6","41",2009,"NA NA NA","SHAHID BAHONAR UNIVERSITY OF KERMAN;LORESTAN UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;SHAHID BAHONAR UNIVERSITY OF KERMAN;NOTREPORTED",NA,"GHASEMI N, 2009, ANDROLOGIA","GHASEMI N, 2009, ANDROLOGIA"

PHARMACOL.","PATERNAL GERMLINE EXPOSURE TO ORGANOPHOSPHOROUS PESTICIDES (OP) HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH REPRODUCTIVE FAILURES AND ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE OFFSPRING. METHYL-PARATHION (ME-PA), A WORLDWIDE-USED OP, HAS REPRODUCTIVE ADVERSE EFFECTS AND IS GENOTOXIC TO SPERM, POSSIBLY VIA OXIDATIVE DAMAGE. THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED THE STAGES OF SPERMATOGENESIS SUSCEPTIBLE TO BE TARGETED BY ME-PA EXPOSURE THAT IMPACT ON SPERMATOZOA FUNCTION AND THEIR ABILITY TO FERTILIZE. MALE MICE WERE EXPOSED TO ME-PA (20MG/KG BW, I.P.) AND SPERMATOZOA FROM EPIDIDYMIS-VAS DEFERENS WERE COLLECTED AT 7 OR 28DAYS POST-TREATMENT (DPT) TO ASSESS THE EFFECTS ON MATURING SPERMATOZOA AND SPERMATOCYTES, RESPECTIVELY. SPERMATOZOA WERE EXAMINED FOR DNA DAMAGE BY NICK TRANSLATION (NT-POSITIVE CELLS) AND SCSA (%DFI), LIPOPEROXIDATION (LPO) BY MALONDIALDEHYDE PRODUCTION, SPERM FUNCTION BY SPONTANEOUS- AND INDUCED-ACROSOME REACTIONS (AR), MITOCHONDRIAL MEMBRANE POTENTIAL (MMP) BY USING THE JC-1 FLUOROCHROME, AND FERTILIZATION ABILITY BY AN IN VITRO ASSAY AND IN VIVO MATING. ALTERATIONS ON DNA INTEGRITY (%DFI AND NT-POSITIVE CELLS) IN SPERMATOZOA COLLECTED AT 7 AND 28DPT, AND DECREASES IN SPERM QUALITY AND INDUCED-AR WERE OBSERVED; REDUCED MMP AND LPO WERE OBSERVED AT 7DPT ONLY. NEGATIVE CORRELATIONS BETWEEN LPO AND SPERM ALTERATIONS WERE FOUND. ALTERED SPERM FUNCTIONAL PARAMETERS EVALUATED EITHER IN VITRO OR IN VIVO WERE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED FERTILIZATION RATES AT BOTH TIMES. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT ME-PA EXPOSURE OF MATURING SPERMATOZOA AND SPERMATOCYTES AFFECTS MANY SPERM FUNCTIONAL PARAMETERS THAT RESULT IN A DECREASED FERTILIZING CAPACITY. OXIDATIVE STRESS SEEMS TO BE A LIKELY MECHANISM OF THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS OF ME-PA EXPOSURE IN MALE GERM CELLS. 2009 ELSEVIER INC.

HEALTH PERSPECT.","BACKGROUND: THE ETIOLOGY OF CHILDHOOD BRAIN CANCER REMAINS LARGELY UNKNOWN. HOWEVER, PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE YIELDED SUGGESTIVE ASSOCIATIONS WITH PARENTAL PESTICIDE USE. OBJECTIVES: WE AIMED TO EVALUATE PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES AT HOME AND ON THE JOB IN RELATION TO THE OCCURRENCE OF BRAIN CANCER IN CHILDREN. METHODS: WE INCLUDED 526 ONE-TO-ONE-MATCHED CASE-CONTROL PAIRS. BRAIN CANCER CASES WERE DIAGNOSED AT < 10 YEARS OF AGE, AND WERE IDENTIFIED FROM STATEWIDE CANCER REGISTRIES OF FOUR U.S. ATLANTIC COAST STATES. WE SELECTED CONTROLS BY RANDOM DIGIT DIALING. WE CONDUCTED COMPUTER-ASSISTED TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS WITH MOTHERS. USING INFORMATION ON RESIDENTIAL PESTICIDE USE AND JOBS HELD BY FATHERS DURING THE 2-YEAR PERIOD BEFORE THE CHILD'S BIRTH, WE ASSESSED POTENTIAL EXPOSURE TO INSECTICIDES, HERBICIDES, AND FUNGICIDES. FOR EACH JOB, TWO RATERS INDEPENDENTLY CLASSIFIED THE PROBABILITY AND INTENSITY OF EXPOSURE; 421 PAIRS WERE AVAILABLE FOR FINAL ANALYSIS. WE CALCULATED ODDS RATIOS (ORS) AND 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVALS (CIS) USING CONDITIONAL LOGISTIC REGRESSION, AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR MATERNAL EDUCATION. RESULTS: A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF ASTROCYTOMA WAS ASSOCIATED WITH EXPOSURES TO HERBICIDES FROM RESIDENTIAL USE (OR = 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0). COMBINING PARENTAL EXPOSURES TO HERBICIDES FROM BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND OCCUPATIONAL SOURCES, THE ELEVATED RISK REMAINED SIGNIFICANT (OR = 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-3.1). WE OBSERVED LITTLE ASSOCIATION WITH PRIMITIVE NEUROECTODERMAL TUMORS (PNET) FOR ANY OF THE PESTICIDE CLASSES OR EXPOSURE SOURCES CONSIDERED. CONCLUSIONS: OUR OBSERVATION IS CONSISTENT WITH A PREVIOUS LITERATURE REPORTING SUGGESTIVE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PARENTAL EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES AND RISK OF ASTROCYTOMA IN OFFSPRING BUT NOT PNET.

REPROD.","THIS STUDY AIMS TO ANALYZE, IN MICE, THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF DELAYED FATHERHOOD ON POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT, SPONTANEOUS MOTOR ACTIVITY, AND LEARNING CAPACITY OF OFFSPRING. HYBRID PARENTAL-GENERATION (F0) MALES, AT THE AGE OF 12, 70, 100, AND 120 WK, WERE INDIVIDUALLY HOUSED WITH A RANDOMLY SELECTED 12- WK-OLD HYBRID FEMALE. THE RESULTING FIRST-GENERATION (F 1) OFFSPRING WERE TESTED FOR SEVERAL DEVELOPMENTAL AND BEHAVIORAL VARIABLES. CUMULATIVE PERCENTAGE OF F1 PUPS THAT ATTAINED IMMEDIATE RIGHTING IN THE 120-WK GROUP WAS LOWER THAN THAT FOUND IN THE 12-, 70-, AND 100-WK GROUPS. FURTHERMORE, THE POSTNATAL DAY OF ATTAINING IMMEDIATE RIGHTING WAS HIGHER IN PUPS FROM THE 120-WK GROUP WHEN COMPARED TO PUPS FROM THE OTHER AGE-GROUPS. AT THE AGE OF 20 WK, F1 OFFSPRING FROM THE 120-WK GROUP DISPLAYED LOWER COUNTS OF MOTOR ACTIVITY THAN OFFSPRING FROM THE 12-, 70-, AND 100-WK GROUPS. ONE WEEK LATER, A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OFFSPRING FROM THE 100- AND 120-WK GROUPS ENTERED THE DARK COMPARTMENT DURING THE RETENTION TRIAL OF THE PASSIVE-AVOIDANCE TEST WHEN COMPARED TO OFFSPRING FROM THE 12- WK GROUP. OFFSPRING FROM THE 120-WK GROUP EXHIBITED ALSO LOWER STEP-THROUGH LATENCY IN THE RETENTION TRIAL THAN OFFSPRING FROM THE 12-, 70-, AND 100-WK GROUPS.

HYBRID PARENTAL-GENERATION (F0) MALES, AT THE AGE OF 12, 70, 100, AND 120 WK, WERE INDIVIDUALLY HOUSED WITH A RANDOMLY SELECTED 12-WK-OLD HYBRID FEMALE. THE REPRODUCTIVE FITNESS OF FIRST-GENERATION (F1) FEMALES WAS TESTED FROM THE AGE OF 25 WK UNTIL THE END OF THEIR REPRODUCTIVE LIFE. IN F1 MALES, THE TESTING PERIOD RANGED FROM THE AGE OF 52 WK UNTIL DEATH. BREEDING F1 FEMALES FROM THE 120-WK GROUP DISPLAYED INTERBIRTH INTERVALS LONGER THAN FEMALES FROM THE 12-, 70-, AND 100-WK GROUPS. FURTHERMORE, F 2 PUPS BEGOTTEN BY F1 STUDS EXHIBITED WEANING WEIGHTS LOWER THAN PUPS FROM THE 12- AND 70-WK GROUPS. OFFSPRING FROM THE 120-WK GROUP EXHIBITED SHORTER SURVIVAL TIMES ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER INCIDENCE OF TUMORIGENESIS AND HIGHER LOSS OF BODY WEIGHT WHEN APPROACHING DEATH WHEN COMPARED TO F1 OFFSPRING FROM YOUNGER AGE-GROUPS.

BIOL.","IT IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED THAT MATERNAL PHENOTYPE CAN HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING, BUT PATERNAL PHENOTYPE IS GENERALLY ASSUMED TO HAVE NO INFLUENCE IN ANIMALS LACKING PATERNAL CARE. NONETHELESS, SELECTION MAY FAVOUR THE TRANSFER OF ENVIRONMENTALLY ACQUIRED CONDITION TO OFFSPRING FROM BOTH PARENTS. USING A SPLIT-BROOD, CROSS-GENERATIONAL LABORATORY DESIGN, WE MANIPULATED A KEY ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANT OF CONDITION - LARVAL DIET QUALITY - OF PARENTS AND THEIR OFFSPRING IN THE FLY TELOSTYLINUS ANGUSTICOLLIS, IN WHICH THERE IS NO EVIDENCE OF PATERNAL PROVISIONING. PARENTAL DIET DID NOT AFFECT OFFSPRING SURVIVAL, BUT HIGH-CONDITION MOTHERS PRODUCED LARGER EGGS, AND THEIR OFFSPRING DEVELOPED MORE RAPIDLY WHEN ON A POOR LARVAL DIET. MATERNAL CONDITION HAD NO EFFECT ON ADULT BODY SIZE OF OFFSPRING. BY CONTRAST, LARGE, HIGH-CONDITION FATHERS PRODUCED LARGER OFFSPRING, AND FOLLOW-UP ASSAYS SHOWED THAT THIS PATERNAL EFFECT CAN BE SUFFICIENT TO INCREASE MATING SUCCESS OF MALE OFFSPRING AND FECUNDITY OF FEMALE OFFSPRING. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT BOTH MOTHERS AND FATHERS TRANSFER THEIR CONDITION TO OFFSPRING, BUT WITH EFFECTS ON DIFFERENT OFFSPRING TRAITS. MOREOVER, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PATERNAL EFFECTS CAN BE IMPORTANT EVEN IN SPECIES LACKING CONVENTIONAL FORMS OF PATERNAL CARE. IN SUCH SPECIES, THE TRANSFER OF PATERNAL CONDITION TO OFFSPRING COULD CONTRIBUTE TO INDIRECT SELECTION ON FEMALE MATE PREFERENCES. 2007 THE AUTHORS.",NA,NA,"JEBIE","BONDURIANSKY, R.; EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY RESEARCH CENTRE, SCHOOL OF BIOLOGICAL, EARTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES, SYDNEY, NSW 2052, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: R.BONDURIANSKY@UNSW.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.1420-9101.2007.01419.x",NA,"1010061X","JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,89,"6",NA,"2379-2388",NA,"17956399","SCOPUS","MATERNAL AND PATERNAL CONDITION EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE IN TELOSTYLINUS ANGUSTICOLLIS (DIPTERA: NERIIDAE)",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-35448994467&doi=10.1111%2fj.1420-9101.2007.01419.x&partnerID=40&md5=97b12b26acb96e1e5fe309c448420a94","20",2007,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES;UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN;UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF NEW SOUTH WALES;NOTREPORTED",NA,"BONDURIANSKY R, 2007, J EVOL BIOL","BONDURIANSKY R, 2007, J EVOL BIOL"

SOC.","MOST STUDIES DEALING WITH THE TRADE-OFF BETWEEN OFFSPRING NUMBER AND QUALITY HAVE OVERLOOKED THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PROGENY. HIGH INVESTMENT IN OFFSPRING NUMBER USUALLY RESULTS IN AN INCREASED COMPETITION AMONG NEST MATES. THE DETERIORATION OF THE EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONS, DUE TO THIS INCREASED COMPETITION, CAN IMPAIR INDIVIDUAL QUALITY OVER THE LONG TERM, AND SUBSEQUENTLY AFFECT SURVIVAL AND LIFETIME FECUNDITY. MOREOVER, THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE ALLOCATION RULE TO OFFSPRING NUMBER VS. QUALITY CAN EXTEND ACROSS GENERATIONS AND GIVE RAISE TO GRANDPARENTAL EFFECTS. THESE TRANSGENERATIONAL TRADE-OFFS HAVE BEEN EXPLORED RARELY. IN THE PRESENT STUDY, WE MANIPULATED THE BREEDING EFFORT OF CAPTIVE ZEBRA FINCHES (TAENIOPYGIA GUTTATA) BY OFFERING THEM ENLARGED OR REDUCED BROODS. OFFSPRING REARED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS WERE ALLOWED TO BREED FREELY IN AN OUTDOOR AVIARY, DURING THEIR ENTIRE LIFESPAN. SECOND-GENERATION FLEDGLINGS WHOSE MOTHER WAS RAISED IN ENLARGED BROODS WERE IN LOWER BODY CONDITION THAN OFFSPRING WHOSE MOTHER WAS RAISED IN REDUCED BROODS. HOWEVER, SECOND-GENERATION FLEDGLINGS WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE BROOD SIZE EXPERIENCED BY THE FATHER. THESE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE SOLUTION OF PARENTAL DILEMMA, WHETHER PRODUCING A SMALL NUMBER OF HIGH QUALITY OFFSPRING OR A LARGE NUMBER OF POOR QUALITY DESCENDANTS, MUST TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE LONG-TERM TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS ACTING ON GRANDCHILDREN. 2007 THE LINNEAN SOCIETY OF LONDON.",NA,NA,"BJLSB","ALONSO-ALVAREZ, C.; UNIDAD DE ECOLOGA, INSTITUTO DE INVESTIGACIN EN RECURSOS CINEGTICOS IREC (CSIC, UCLM, JCCM), RONDA DE TOLEDO, S/N, 13005 CIUDAD REAL, SPAIN; EMAIL: CALONSO@UCLM.ES","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.1095-8312.2007.00811.x",NA,"00244066","BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,10,"3",NA,"469-474",NA,NA,"SCOPUS","SEX-SPECIFIC TRANSGENERATIONAL EFFECTS OF EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONS IN A PASSERINE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34447135511&doi=10.1111%2fj.1095-8312.2007.00811.x&partnerID=40&md5=ea5b1553490dff03ef4384fc40bd2993","91",2007,"NA NA NA","INSTITUTO DE INVESTIGACIN EN RECURSOS CINEGTICOS IREC (CSIC;UNIVERSIT PIERRE ET MARIE CURIE;UNIVERSIT DE BOURGOGNE","NOTREPORTED;INSTITUTO DE INVESTIGACIN EN RECURSOS CINEGTICOS IREC (CSIC;NOTREPORTED",NA,"ALONSO-ALVAREZ C, 2007, BIOL J LINN SOC","ALONSO-ALVAREZ C, 2007, BIOL J LINN SOC"

BEHAV.","SWISS WEBSTER PUPS WERE FATHERED BY SIRES GIVEN EITHER AN ACUTE DOSE OF ALCOHOL (ALCOHOL-SIRED) OR SALINE (SALINE-SIRED) 12-24H BEFORE MATING. THE SAME SIRES WERE USED TO FATHER BOTH GROUPS OF PUPS. ALCOHOL-SIRED PUPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LIGHTER AT BIRTH AND FOR THE FOLLOWING THREE WEEKS THAN WERE SALINE-SIRED PUPS. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PUPS WERE FATHERED BY SALINE-EXPOSED SIRES, AND DAMS CARRYING THOSE PUPS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LONGER GESTATIONS THAN THOSE CARRYING PUPS OF ALCOHOL-USING SIRES. MORE RUNTS WERE BORN TO THE ALCOHOL-SIRED GROUP, AND MORE PUPS IN THAT GROUP DIED OVER THE NEXT THREE WEEKS THAN IN THE SALINE-SIRED GROUP. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE PUPS IN THE SALINE-SIRED GROUP ACHIEVED SUCH DEVELOPMENTAL MILESTONES AS SURFACE RIGHTING, CLINGING, THE TAIL-PULL REFLEX, ROTATION, LINEAR MOVEMENT AND CLIMBING AN INCLINED SURFACE EARLIER THAN DID ALCOHOL-SIRED PUPS. AS ADULTS, ANIMALS FROM THE ALCOHOL-SIRED GROUP SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS RISK ASSESSMENT BEHAVIOR AND LONGER LATENCIES TO SUCH BEHAVIORS AS STRETCHED ATTENTION, FLATBACK, FREEZING AND DEFENSIVE BURYING THAN DID THE SALINE-SIRED ANIMALS. ALCOHOL-SIRED ANIMALS CONTACTED THE STIMULUS OBJECT IN THE RISK ASSESSMENT TEST SIGNIFICANTLY SOONER AND MORE OFTEN THAN DID THE SALINE-SIRED GROUP. IN TESTS OF AGGRESSION, ALCOHOL-SIRED MALE OFFSPRING SHOWED MORE FREQUENT AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIORS SUCH AS ON-TOP, LATERAL ATTACKS AND JUMP-ATTACKS, AND SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER DEFENSIVE/FEARFUL BEHAVIORS SUCH AS PILOERECTION, TAIL RATTLING AND JUMP-ESCAPE. THIS PATTERN OF RESULTS SUGGESTS THAT EXPOSURE OF THE SIRE TO ONE ACUTE DOSE OF ALCOHOL BEFORE INSEMINATION CAUSED SOME EARLY DEVELOPMENTAL DELAYS AND THAT ALCOHOL-SIRED ANIMALS ARE LESS FEARFUL AND MORE AGGRESSIVE AS ADULTS THAN SALINE-SIRED ANIMALS. 2007 ELSEVIER INC.

PRIOR TO BREEDING, MINNOWS WERE EITHER EXPOSED TO 50 G/L CD OR SHAM EXPOSED FOR 21 D. AFTER EXPOSURES, MINNOWS WERE PAIRED (MALE X FEMALE) INTO ONE OF FOUR BREEDING GROUPS-CONTROL X CONTROL (C X C), CONTROL X EXPOSED (C X E), EXPOSED X CONTROL (E X C) OR EXPOSED X EXPOSED (E X E). PAIRS OF MINNOWS WERE SUBJECTED TO A 21-D BREEDING STUDY DURING WHICH THE REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS MENTIONED ABOVE WERE MEASURED. DURING THE BREEDING STUDY, MINNOWS IN THE E X E PAIRS HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MORTALITY THAN MINNOWS IN THE C X C PAIRS; HOWEVER, THE MORTALITY OF MINNOWS IN THE C X E AND E X C DID NOT DIFFER FROM THAT OF C X C PAIRS. PRESUMABLY, BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES EXPOSED TO CD ACCOUNTED FOR THE INCREASED MORTALITY IN THE E X E GROUP. THE RESULTS OF THE BREEDING STUDY DID NOT REVEAL ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES AMONG ANY OF THE REPRODUCTIVE PARAMETERS MEASURED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF OFFSPRING MORTALITY. OFFSPRING FROM C X E PAIRS DID NOT DIFFER FROM OFFSPRING FROM C X C PAIRS WITH REGARD TO MORTALITY; HOWEVER, OFFSPRING FROM PAIRS CONTAINING EXPOSED MALES (E X C AND E X E) HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER MORTALITY THAN OFFSPRING FROM C X C PAIRS SUGGESTING THAT PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO CD LEADS TO AN INCREASE IN OFFSPRING MORTALITY. 2007 SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA, LLC.",NA,"CADMIUM, 22537-48-0, 7440-43-9; CADMIUM, 7440-43-9; WATER POLLUTANTS, CHEMICAL","AECTC","SELLIN, M.K.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AT OMAHA, 6001 DODGE STREET, OMAHA, NE 68182-0040, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: MSELLIN@MAIL.UNOMAHA.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1007/s00244-006-0222-0",NA,"00904341","ARCHIVES OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND TOXICOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,4,"4",NA,"535-540",NA,"17354034","SCOPUS","CADMIUM EXPOSURES IN FATHEAD MINNOWS: ARE THERE SEX-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN MORTALITY, REPRODUCTIVE SUCCESS, AND CD ACCUMULATION?",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-34247209670&doi=10.1007%2fs00244-006-0222-0&partnerID=40&md5=e98f46c3e52b22ffcadfe37175457ca6","52",2007,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AT OMAHA","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AT OMAHA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"SELLIN MK, 2007, ARCH ENVIRON CONTAM TOXICOL","SELLIN MK, 2007, ARCH ENVIRON CONTAM TOXICOL"

HOWEVER, FEW STUDIES HAVE EXAMINED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE EXPOSURE OF LABORATORY ANIMALS TO TCDD, ESPECIALLY THAT OF MALES, COULD LEAD TO A LOWER MALE/FEMALE SEX RATIO. THE AIM OF THIS STUDY WAS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER DIRECT PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO TCDD AFFECTS THE SEX RATIO OF OFFSPRING USING A RELATIVELY LARGE-SCALE EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN. MALE ICR MICE (N=120) WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO THREE, ONE OF WHICH SERVED AS A VEHICLE CONTROL, THE OTHER TWO WERE ADMINISTERED TCDD ORALLY WITH AN INITIAL LOADING DOSE OF 2 OR 2,000 NG TCDD/KG, FOLLOWED BY A WEEKLY MAINTENANCE DOSE OF 0.4 (T2/0.4 GROUP) OR 400 (T2000/400 GROUP) NG/KG PRIOR TO MATING. THE MAJOR ORGANS OF EACH MOUSE WERE WEIGHED AND HISTOPATHOLOGICALLY AND IMMUNOHISTOLOGICALLY INVESTIGATED, AND THE SEX RATIO OF OFFSPRING [MALES/(MALES + FEMALES) X 100] WAS CALCULATED IN EACH DAM. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS ON ORGAN WEIGHTS, OR ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE TESTIS AND EPIDIDYMIS BETWEEN THE CONTROL AND TCDD-EXPOSED MALES, BUT TCDD ADMINISTRATION PRODUCED A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER PROPORTION OF MALE OFFSPRING FROM T2000/400-EXPOSED SIRES DESPITE NO ALTERATION IN LITTER SIZE (CONTROL: 53.1 1.7; T2/0.4: 48.8 2.5; T2000/400: 46.2 2.1). IN ADDITION, WE FURTHER DIVIDED THE T2000/400 GROUP INTO 3 SUBGROUPS BASED ON THE PROPORTION OF CYP1A1- IMMUNOREACTIVE AREAS IN THE LIVER; THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT CORRELATION BETWEEN SEX RATIO AND CYP1A1 IMMUNOREACTIVITY. THUS, THE PRESENT STUDY CONFIRMS THAT DIRECT PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO TCDD MIGHT BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN ALTERATION IN THE SEX RATIO OF OFFSPRING.

J. ANDROL.","THIS WAS AN OPEN CASE-CONTROL STUDY OF THE POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PARENTAL OCCUPATIONAL AND DOMESTIC EXPOSURES TO POTENTIAL ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS (EDC) ASSESSED BY QUESTIONNAIRE AND CRYPTORCHIDISM AND HYPOSPADIAS IN THEIR OFFSPRING IN THE AGRICULTURAL AREA OF RAGUSA. CASES OF INFANTS BORN BETWEEN 1998 AND 2002 WITH EITHER OF THESE TWO MALFORMATIONS (N = 90), AND CONTROLS (N = 203), WERE RECRUITED THROUGH THE PAEDIATRIC SERVICES (FOR CASES) AND A RANDOM SAMPLE OF HEALTHY INFANTS ATTENDING THE SAME SERVICES BORN IN THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME (FOR CONTROLS). DATA ON OCCUPATIONAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES OF PARENTS PRIOR TO AND DURING THE INDEX CASE (OR CONTROL), WERE COLLECTED THROUGH INTERVIEWS WITH BOTH PARENTS. CONCERNING OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES, WE DID NOT FIND A STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RISK AMONG PARENTS DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN AGRICULTURAL WORK. WE DID FIND A NON-STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RISK FOR CRYPTORCHIDISM IN MOTHERS EMPLOYED IN AGRICULTURE [ADJUSTED ODDS RATIOS (OR) 2.97; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI) 0.77-11.47] AND WITH PROBABLE EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES (ADJUSTED OR 2.74; 95% CI 0.72-10.42). FATHERS WHO HAD INDIRECT CONTACT WITH AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS (TRANSPORT AND RETAIL) HAD AN INCREASED RISK (NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT) FOR CRYPTORCHIDISM (ADJUSTED OR 2.45; 95% CI 0.63-9.59) AND HYPOSPADIAS AND CRYPTORCHIDISM COMBINED (ADJUSTED OR 2.24; 95% CI 0.67-7.48). INCREASES IN RISK OF THE TWO MALFORMATIONS POOLED WERE ALSO OBSERVED IN RELATION TO THE MOTHER'S AGE BELOW 25 (ADJUSTED OR 1.99; 95% CI 0.97-4.09), TO THE PRESENCE OF GENITAL DISEASE OF THE FATHER (ADJUSTED OR 2.41; 95%C I0.94-6.17), AND THE MOTHER (ADJUSTED OR 3.47;95% CI1.34-8.99), TO LOW BIRTH WEIGHT OF THE INFANT (ADJUSTED OR 4.49; 95% CI 1.23-16.31). INCREASED RISK WAS ALSO OBSERVED FOR MOTHERS CONSUMING ALCOHOL DURING PREGNANCY (ADJUSTED OR 3.09; 95% CI 0.98-9.66), AND FOR COUPLES WHO CONCEIVED WHILE USING CONDOMS (ADJUSTED OR 2.12; 95% CI 1.02-4.41). THE STUDY THEREFORE PROVIDES ONLY LIMITED SUPPORT TO THE HYPOTHESIS OF A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE RISK OF CRYPTORCHIDISM AND HYPOSPADIAS AND THE OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO EDC AND AGRICULTURAL WORK. 2007 THE AUTHORS.",NA,"ALCOHOL, 64-17-5; ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS","IJAND","FIG-TALAMANCA, I.; DEPARTMENT OF ANIMAL AND HUMAN BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF ROME 'LA SAPIENZA', P.LE ALDO MORO, 500185 ROME, ITALY; EMAIL: IRENE.FIGATALAMANCA@UNIROMA1.IT","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.1365-2605.2006.00703.x",NA,"01056263","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,61,"1",NA,"3-13",NA,"16824044","SCOPUS","THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF ENDOCRINE DISRUPTING CHEMICALS IN THE AETIOLOGY OF CRYPTORCHIDISM AND HYPOSPADIAS: A POPULATION-BASED CASE-CONTROL STUDY IN RURAL SICILY",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-33846516502&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2605.2006.00703.x&partnerID=40&md5=c3f5dfb50cd084e58bd72c70adca2649","30",2007,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF ROME 'LA SAPIENZA';NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF HEALTH;UNIVERSITY OF ROME 'LA SAPIENZA'","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF ROME 'LA SAPIENZA';NOTREPORTED",NA,"CARBONE P, 2007, INT J ANDROL","CARBONE P, 2007, INT J ANDROL"

MALE RATS WERE EXPOSED TO (PHSE)2 SUBCUTANEOUSLY FOR 4 WEEKS AT THE DOSE OF 5.0 MG/KG AND 8 WEEKS AT THE DOSE OF 2.5 MG/KG, PRIOR TO MATING WITH UNEXPOSED FEMALES. NO LETHALITY WAS NOTED IN ANY GROUP. AT TERM OF EXPOSURE PERIOD, 4-WEEK EXPOSED MALE RATS PRESENTED SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE BODY WEIGHT. SEX ORGAN WEIGHTS WERE SIMILAR IN (PHSE)2-EXPOSED AND CONTROL MALE GROUPS. THE NUMBER OF IMPLANTATION SITES IN FEMALES MATED WITH MALES EXPOSED TO (PHSE)2 FOR 8 WEEKS WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE OF THE RESPECTIVE CONTROL GROUP. MALE EXPOSURE TO (PHSE)2, ADMINISTERED FOR 4 AND 8 WEEKS, DID NOT CHANGE FETAL BODY WEIGHT. GROSS EXAMINATION OF FETUSES FROM 4- TO 8-WEEK EXPOSED GROUPS DID NOT REVEAL THE APPEARANCE OF EXTERNAL ANOMALIES. EXAMINATION OF LIVE FETUSES FOR OSSIFICATION CENTERS DID NOT SHOW SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROUPS. NO INCREASE IN THE INCIDENCE OF SKELETAL ANOMALIES WAS OBSERVED IN FETUSES OBTAINED FROM FEMALES IMPREGNATED WITH (PHSE)2-EXPOSED MALES.

OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO ASSESS ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN PATERNAL OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO RFR AND ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOMES INCLUDING BIRTH DEFECTS USING POPULATION-BASED DATA FROM NORWAY. METHODS: DATA ON REPRODUCTIVE OUTCOMES DERIVED FROM THE MEDICAL BIRTH REGISTRY OF NORWAY WERE LINKED WITH DATA ON PATERNAL OCCUPATION DERIVED FROM THE GENERAL POPULATION CENSUSES. AN EXPERT PANEL CATEGORIZED OCCUPATIONS ACCORDING TO EXPOSURE. USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION, WE ANALYZED 24 CATEGORIES OF BIRTH DEFECTS AS WELL AS OTHER ADVERSE OUTCOMES. RESULTS: IN THE OFFSPRING OF FATHERS MOST LIKELY TO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED, INCREASED RISK WAS OBSERVED FOR PRETERM BIRTH (ODDS RATIO (OR): 1.08, 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI): 1.03, 1.15). IN THIS GROUP WE ALSO OBSERVED A DECREASED RISK OF CLEFT LIP (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.97). IN THE MEDIUM EXPOSED GROUP, WE OBSERVED INCREASED RISK FOR A CATEGORY OF ""OTHER DEFECTS"" (OR: 2.40, 95% CI: 1.22, 4.70), AND A DECREASED RISK FOR A CATEGORY OF ""OTHER SYNDROMES"" (OR: 0.75, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.99) AND UPPER GASTROINTESTINAL DEFECTS (OR: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.40, 0.93).

OBJECTIVE: THIS STUDY AIMED TO DETERMINE WHETHER EXPOSURE TO PATERNAL CHEWING OF BETEL NUT QUIDS LED TO AN INCREASED RISK OF EARLY MANIFESTATION OF THE METABOLIC SYNDROME (METS) IN HUMAN OFFSPRING. DESIGN: THE SUBJECTS WERE SELECTED FROM 66 971 RESIDENTS AGED >19 Y WHO ATTENDED A COMMUNITY-BASED INTEGRATED SCREENING PROGRAM IN TAIWAN AND WHO WERE IDENTIFIED AS PARENT-CHILD TRIOS (N = 5037). USING A POPULATION-BASED, PARENT-CHILD STUDY DESIGN, WE COMPARED THE MEAN AGES OF OFFSPRING WITH METS AT ENTRY BETWEEN THOSE WHO WERE EXPOSED AND THOSE WHO WERE UNEXPOSED TO PATERNAL CHEWING OF QUIDS CONTAINING BETEL NUT. COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS REGRESSION MODELS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIOS AND TO ASSESS DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONS FOR PATERNAL BETEL-QUID EXPOSURE. RESULTS: THE OFFSPRING WHO WERE EXPOSED TO PATERNAL BETEL-QUID CHEWING WERE YOUNGER THAN THOSE WHO WERE NOT EXPOSED, REGARDLESS OF METS STATUS; THEY ALSO HAD A 2.14-FOLD INCREASE IN THE RISK OF EARLY MANIFESTATION OF METS (ADJUSTED HAZARD RATIO = 2.14; 95% CI: 1.25, 3.66) AFTER CONTROL FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER RISK FACTORS, INCLUDING PERSONAL BETEL CHEWING. SIGNIFICANT DOSE-RESPONSE RELATIONS WERE FOUND BETWEEN THE RISK OF EARLY METS AND THE QUANTITY AND DURATION OF PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO BETEL QUIDS. IN THE ABSENCE OF METS IN EITHER PARENT AND OF BETEL-QUID CONSUMPTION BY THE OFFSPRING, PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO BETEL QUIDS INCREASED THE RISK OF EARLY MANIFESTATION OF METS IN OFFSPRING 2.53-FOLD (95% CI: 1.03, 2.64) COMPARED WITH PATERNAL NONEXPOSURE.

IN THIS MODEL, MICE WERE TRAINED TO SELF-ADMINISTER COC IN MULTI-HOUR DAILY INHALATION SESSIONS REMINISCENT OF CRACK BINGES. THE CONTROLS INCLUDED MALES PAIR-FED WITH COC-INHALING ANIMALS AS WELL AS AD-LIB-FED MALES. ALL MALES WERE BRED WITH DRUG-NAIVE FEMALES. THE NEWBORN PUPS SIRED BY COC-INHALING MALES HAD A REDUCED BIPARIETAL HEAD DIAMETER, SUGGESTING A DECREASED CEREBRAL VOLUME. WHEN THE PUPS REACHED ADULTHOOD, THEIR SUSTAINED VISUO-SPATIAL ATTENTION AND SPATIAL WORKING MEMORY WERE TESTED USING A 5-ARM MAZE PARADIGM. DURING THE ATTENTION TESTS, THE PERCENTAGE OF CORRECT TRIALS AT THE SHORTEST STIMULUS DURATION EMPLOYED IN THE STUDY (0.5 S) WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FOR THE MALE OFFSPRING OF COC-INHALING FATHERS AS COMPARED TO THE OFFSPRING OF BOTH PAIR-FED AND AD-LIB-FED CONTROLS. FOR THE FEMALES SIRED BY COC-INHALING FATHERS, THE DEFICIT WAS OBSERVED AT LIGHT STIMULUS DURATIONS OF 0.5 AND 0.75 S. ALSO, DURING THE WORKING MEMORY TESTS, THE MALE OFFSPRING OF COC-INHALING FATHERS REQUIRED MORE SESSIONS THAN THE OFFSPRING OF EITHER PAIR-FED OR AD-LIB-FED FATHERS TO REACH THE SELECTED CRITERION AT RETENTION INTERVALS OF 16 MIN AND LONGER. THE IMPAIRMENT OF WORKING MEMORY IN FEMALE OFFSPRING OF COC-INHALING FATHERS WAS EVEN STRONGER, AS THE OFFSPRING NEEDED MORE SESSIONS TO REACH THE CRITERION AS COMPARED TO THEIR CONTROL COUNTERPARTS, EVEN AT RETENTION INTERVALS AS SHORT AS 4 MIN. THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PATERNAL COC ABUSE PRIOR TO COITUS MAY IMPACT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFSPRING, PARTICULARLY IF THEY ARE FEMALES. WE FURTHER SHOWED THAT CHRONIC COC EXPOSURE IN MALE MICE DOES NOT RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL BREAKAGE OF SPERMATOZOAL DNA, BUT SIGNIFICANTLY ALTERS EXPRESSION OF DNA METHYLTRANSFERASES 1 AND 3A IN THE GERM CELL-RICH SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES OF THE TESTIS. SINCE THESE ENZYMES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR GENERATING AND MAINTAINING PARENTAL GENE IMPRINTING IN GERM CELLS, OUR OBSERVATIONS POINT TO AN INTRIGUING POSSIBILITY THAT COC MAY CAUSE PATERNALLY INDUCED NEUROTERATOLOGICAL EFFECTS BY INTERFERING WITH GENE-IMPRINTING PATTERNS IN MALE GAMETES. 2006 ELSEVIER INC.

ADVANCES IN TREATMENT OF THE DISEASE, WHICH INCLUDE THE COADMINISTRATION OF BLEOMYCIN, ETOPOSIDE, AND CIS-PLATINUM (BEP), HAVE BROUGHT THE CURE RATE TO OVER 90%. THIS HIGH CURE RATE, COUPLED WITH THE YOUNG AGE OF PATIENTS, MAKES ELUCIDATION OF THE IMPACT OF THE TREATMENT ON REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION, FERTILITY, AND PROGENY OUTCOME INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT. THE GOAL OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF BEP, IN DOSES ANALOGOUS TO THOSE GIVEN TO HUMANS, ON THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM, SPERMATOZOA, FERTILITY, AND PROGENY OUTCOME IN AN ANIMAL MODEL. MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE TREATED DAILY WITH BEP FOR 3 CYCLES OF 3 WEEKS EACH, FOR A TOTAL OF 9 WEEKS. AFTER 6 AND 9 WEEKS, MALES WERE MATED TO 2 GROUPS OF UNTREATED FEMALES. BEP TREATMENT RESULTED IN DECREASES IN TESTICULAR AND EPIDIDYMAL WEIGHTS OF 52% AND 28%, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROL. DECREASED TESTIS AND EPIDIDYMIS WEIGHTS WERE ACCOMPANIED BY IMPAIRMENT OF SPERMATOGENESIS AND BY A DECREASE IN SPERMATOZOAL COUNT OF NEARLY 90% (11.9 107 SPERMATOZOA PER CAPUT EPIDIDYMIDIS IN CONTROL VS 1.65 107 IN BEP-TREATED RATS). THE PERCENT OF MOTILE SPERMATOZOA IN THE TREATED RATS WAS MORE THAN 30% LOWER THAN IN CONTROLS. DEFECTS IN THE FLAGELLA OF SPERMATOZOA INCREASED BY MORE THAN TWOFOLD IN THE MIDPIECE, AND BY MORE THAN SIXFOLD IN THE PRINCIPAL PIECE. PATERNAL BEP TREATMENT, FOR EITHER 6 OR 9 WEEKS, DID NOT AFFECT FERTILITY, PRE- OR POSTIMPLANTATION LOSS, LITTER SIZE, OR SEX RATIO AMONG PROGENY ON GESTATION DAY 21. IN CONTRAST, AMONG THE PREGNANCIES ALLOWED TO PROCEED TO DELIVERY, A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PUPS SIRED BY MALES TREATED WITH BEP FOR 9 WEEKS DIED BETWEEN BIRTH AND POSTNATAL DAY 2; THIS WAS NOT OBSERVED IN PUPS SIRED BY MALES TREATED FOR 6 WEEKS. MARKERS OF POSTNATAL DEVELOPMENT WERE NOT AFFECTED IN THE SURVIVING OFFSPRING FROM EITHER GROUP. THUS, DESPITE THE DRAMATIC EFFECTS OF THE TESTICULAR CANCER DRUG REGIMEN ON SPERMATOGENESIS, THE NUMBERS OF SPERMATOZOA, AND THEIR MOTILITY AND MORPHOLOGY, MALE RATS WERE FERTILE. WHILE FETAL DEVELOPMENT WAS APPARENTLY NORMAL, EARLY POSTNATAL MORTALITY, WHICH MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH A DELAY IN PARTURITION, WAS ELEVATED AMONG THE PROGENY SIRED BY MALES EXPOSED TO BEP FOR 9 WEEKS.

ONE-DIMENSIONAL GEL ELECTROPHORESIS AND AUTORADIOGRAPHS WERE USED TO EXAMINE THE PROTEIN PROFILES BETWEEN THE TWO-CELL EMBRYOS AND THE BLASTOCYSTS. THE RESULTS OBTAINED DEMONSTRATE THAT PATERNAL HEAT STRESS 7 OR 14 DAYS EARLIER DID NOT APPARENTLY AFFECT PROTEIN PATTERNS OF TWO-CELL EMBRYOS, FOUR-CELL TO EIGHT-CELL EMBRYOS, MORULAE OR BLASTOCYSTS. HOWEVER, 21 DAYS EARLIER, THERE WERE CHANGES IN PROTEIN PATTERNS OF TWO-CELL EMBRYOS AND ABNORMAL EMBRYOS, BUT NOT THE MORULAE. TO FURTHER SUPPORT AND EXTEND THESE RESULTS, TWO-DIMENSIONAL GEL ELECTROPHORESIS AND PHOSPHORIMAGING WERE EMPLOYED AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED SHOW THAT PATERNAL HEAT STRESS 21 DAYS BEFORE MATING AFFECTED PROTEIN PROFILES OF TWO-CELL EMBRYOS AND MORULAE IN THE MOUSE. TOGETHER, THESE FINDINGS HAVE INDICATED THAT PATERNAL HEAT STRESS AFFECTS MOST BUT NOT ALL PROTEIN PATTERNS OF PRE-IMPLANTATION EMBRYOS, WHICH STRONGLY SUPPORTS OUR PREVIOUS RESULTS DEMONSTRATING THAT PATERNAL HEAT STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE DEVELOPMENTAL PROPORTION OF PRE-IMPLANTATION EMBRYOS IN THE MOUSE. 2005 BLACKWELL PUBLISHING LTD.",NA,"METHIONINE, 59-51-8, 63-68-3, 7005-18-7; PROTEIN, 67254-75-5; SULFUR 35, 15117-53-0; PROTEINS","IJAND","ZHU, B.; FACULTY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, CAMDEN, NSW 2570, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: BZHU7534@USYD.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.1365-2605.2005.00530.x",NA,"01056263","INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,2,"3",NA,"128-136",NA,"15910537","SCOPUS","THE EFFECT OF PATERNAL HEAT STRESS ON PROTEIN PROFILES OF PRE-IMPLANTATION EMBRYOS IN THE MOUSE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-20344390055&doi=10.1111%2fj.1365-2605.2005.00530.x&partnerID=40&md5=baee8d7fc94d7f4387b3b2f51a06a9a1","28",2005,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"ZHU B, 2005, INT J ANDROL","ZHU B, 2005, INT J ANDROL"

FEMALE C57/CBA MICE WERE SUPEROVULATED USING ECG/HCG AND MATED EITHER TO AN UNTREATED (CONTROL) MALE MOUSE OR TO ONE THAT HAD BEEN EXPOSED FOR 24 H TO AN AMBIENT TEMPERATURE OF 36 0.1 C AND 62 0.4% RELATIVE HUMIDITY, BETWEEN 3 AND 42 DAYS PREVIOUSLY. PUTATIVE ZYGOTES WERE COLLECTED FROM THE OVIDUCTS OF MATED MICE, 25-28 H AFTER HCG INJECTION, AND CULTURED IN VITRO. EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT WAS EVALUATED AT 24-H INTERVALS FOR UP TO 120 H. PATERNAL HEAT STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE PROPORTION OF EMBRYOS THAT DEVELOPED NORMALLY DURING 24-120 H OF IN VITRO CULTURE, WHEN ZYGOTES WERE SIRED BY MALES WHICH HAD BEEN HEAT STRESSED BETWEEN 7 AND 35 DAYS PRIOR TO MATING. MAXIMUM IMPAIRMENT TO DEVELOPMENT (INCLUDING NONDEVELOPMENT, ABNORMAL AND DYING/DEAD EMBRYOS) OCCURRED IN THOSE EMBRYOS SIRED BY MALES AT DAYS 14 AND 21 AFTER HEATING. EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT RETURNED TO CONTROL LEVELS BY DAY 42 AFTER HEAT STRESS. FURTHERMORE, WHILST ALL STAGES OF EMBRYO DEVELOPMENT WERE AFFECTED BY PATERNAL HEAT STRESS, THE PROPORTION OF EMBRYOS AT THE TWO-CELL STAGE APPEARED TO BE MOST SEVERELY AFFECTED. FOUR-CELL TO MORULA STAGES AND THE MORULA TO BLASTOCYST STAGE ALSO DEMONSTRATED IMPAIRMENT AT DAYS 14, 21, 28 AND 35 AFTER HEATING. THESE RESULTS DEMONSTRATE THAT A SINGLE EPISODE OF PATERNAL HEAT STRESS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PREIMPLANTATION EMBRYOS, AND THIS IS NOT RECOVERED UNTIL DAY 42 AFTER HEATING. THE PRESENT RESULTS ALSO SUPPORT PREVIOUS WORK DEMONSTRATING THAT SPERM FROM THE EPIDIDYMIS AS WELL AS GERM CELLS IN THE TESTIS ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO DAMAGE BY HEAT STRESS, WITH BOTH SPERMATIDS AND SPERMATOCYTES BEING THE MOST VULNERABLE.",NA,NA,"ANDRD","ZHU, B.; FACULTY OF VETERINARY SCIENCE, UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, CAMDEN, NSW 2570, AUSTRALIA; EMAIL: BZHU7534-@USYD.EDU.AU","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.1439-0272.2004.00635.x",NA,"03034569","ANDROLOGIA","ENGLISH",NA,NA,27,"6",NA,"384-394",NA,"15541055","SCOPUS","EFFECT OF PATERNAL HEAT STRESS ON THE DEVELOPMENT IN VITRO OF PREIMPLANTATION EMBRYOS IN THE MOUSE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-9144241859&doi=10.1111%2fj.1439-0272.2004.00635.x&partnerID=40&md5=9a4d18be46320b1583d7e9bdab0d6fd4","36",2004,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY;TURRETFIELD RESEARCH CENTRE;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE;UNIVERSITY OF ADELAIDE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY;NOTREPORTED",NA,"ZHU B, 2004, ANDROLOGIA","ZHU B, 2004, ANDROLOGIA"

HEALTH PERSPECT.","AGENT ORANGE IS A PHENOXY HERBICIDE THAT WAS CONTAMINATED WITH 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD). WE STUDIED PREGNANCY OUTCOMES AMONG WIVES OF MALE CHEMICAL WORKERS WHO WERE HIGHLY EXPOSED TO CHEMICALS CONTAMINATED WITH TCDD AND AMONG WIVES OF NONEXPOSED NEIGHBORHOOD REFERENTS. FOR EXPOSED PREGNANCIES, WE ESTIMATED SERUM TCDD CONCENTRATION AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION USING A PHARMACOKINETIC MODEL. THE MEAN TCDD CONCENTRATION FOR WORKERS' BIRTHS WAS 254 PG/G LIPID (RANGE, 3-16,340 PG/G). THE MEAN REFERENT CONCENTRATION OF 6 PG/G WAS ASSIGNED TO PREGNANCIES FATHERED BY WORKERS BEFORE EXPOSURE. A TOTAL OF 1,117 LIVE SINGLETON BIRTHS OF 217 REFERENT WIVES AND 176 WORKER WIVES WERE INCLUDED. ONLY FULL-TERM BIRTHS WERE INCLUDED IN THE BIRTH WEIGHT ANALYSIS (37 WEEKS OF GESTATION). MEAN BIRTH WEIGHT AMONG FULL-TERM BABIES WAS SIMILAR AMONG REFERENTS' BABIES (N = 604), PREEXPOSURE WORKERS' BABIES (N = 221), AND EXPOSED WORKERS' BABIES (N = 292) (3,420, 3,347, AND 3,442 G, RESPECTIVELY). NEITHER CONTINUOUS NOR CATEGORICAL TCDD CONCENTRATION HAD AN EFFECT ON BIRTH WEIGHT FOR TERM INFANTS AFTER ADJUSTMENT FOR INFANT SEX, MOTHER'S EDUCATION, PARITY, PRENATAL CIGARETTE SMOKING, AND GESTATION LENGTH. AN ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL DIRECT EXPOSURE OF THE WIVES DURING PERIODS OF WORKERS' EXPOSURE YIELDED A NONSTATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN INFANT BIRTH WEIGHT OF 130 G IN THE HIGHEST EXPOSURE GROUP (TCDD CONCENTRATION > 254 PG/G) COMPARED WITH REFERENTS (P = 0.09). MOTHERS' REPORTS OF PRETERM DELIVERY SHOWED A SOMEWHAT PROTECTIVE ASSOCIATION WITH PATERNAL TCDD (LOG) CONCENTRATION (ODDS RATIO = 0:8; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, 0.6-1.1). WE ALSO INCLUDE DESCRIPTIVE INFORMATION ON REPORTED BIRTH DEFECTS. BECAUSE THE ESTIMATED TCDD CONCENTRATIONS IN THIS POPULATION WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN OTHER STUDIES, THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT TCDD IS UNLIKELY TO INCREASE THE RISK OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT OR PRETERM DELIVERY THROUGH A PATERNAL MECHANISM.",NA,"2,3,7,8 TETRACHLORODIBENZO PARA DIOXIN, 1746-01-6; ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTANTS; TETRACHLORODIBENZODIOXIN, 1746-01-6","EVHPA","LAWSON, C.C.; NATL.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: EIGHTY MALE GUINEA PIGS WERE DIVIDED INTO EIGHT EQUAL GROUPS. THE NORMAL CONTROL (NC) GROUP RECEIVED VEHICLE AND SALINE; ONE DOSE OF 1 G/KG BODY WEIGHT TCDD WAS INJECTED INTRAPERITONEALLY INTO THE SINGLE TCDD-TREATED (TT) AND TEST GROUPS (P100, P200, C100, C200); G AND NC GROUPS RECEIVED VEHICLE INSTEAD OF TCDD. P. GINSENG WATER EXTRACT (PG-WE) WAS INJECTED INTRAPERITONEALLY AT DAILY DOSES OF 100 (G100, P100, C100) OR 200 MG/KG BODY WEIGHT (G200, P200, C200). THE PG-WE WAS ADMINISTERED TO THE P AND G GROUPS FOR 12 WEEKS FROM 1 WEEK BEFORE TCDD EXPOSURE, AND TO THE C GROUPS FOR 10 WEEKS FROM 1 WEEK AFTER TCDD EXPOSURE. AFTER A 4-WEEK DISCONTINUATION OF PG-WE TREATMENT AFTER THE 13TH WEEK THE SURVIVING MALES WERE THEN TESTED FOR FERTILITY BY MATING THEM WITH FEMALES. THE LITTER SIZE, DEATH RATE, MALE/FEMALE BIRTH RATIO AND PHYSICAL ABNORMALITIES OF THE PROGENY WERE INVESTIGATED. AFTER CONFIRMING DELIVERY OF THE OFFSPRING, THE PARENT MALES WERE KILLED AT 40 WEEKS, THEIR TESTES WEIGHED AND SPERM QUALITY ASSESSED. RESULTS: ALL TT ANIMALS DIED WITHIN 18 DAYS AFTER TCDD EXPOSURE, BUT 40-70% OF THE PG-WE-TREATED GROUPS, DEPENDING ON THE GROUP, SURVIVED UNTIL DEATH AT 40 WEEKS. ALL THE SURVIVING MALES WERE FERTILE REGARDLESS OF TCDD EXPOSURE; THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE IN LITTER SIZE BETWEEN THE NC AND TEST GROUPS. NOTABLY THE DEATH RATE OF PROGENY BORN TO PG-WE-TREATED GROUPS WAS LOWER THAN THAT OF PROGENY BORN TO THE NC GROUP. THE PROGENY BORN TO TCDD-EXPOSED GROUPS (P200 AND C GROUPS) HAD A PREPONDERANCE OF FEMALES. G GROUP ANIMALS HAD HIGHER SPERM QUALITY THAN THAT OF NCS EVEN LONG AFTER DISCONTINUING PG-WE.

REPROD. DEV.","NUCLEAR TRANSPLANTATION STUDIES DEMONSTRATED THE IMPORTANCE OF PATERNAL CONTRIBUTION TO EMBRYOGENESIS. PATERNAL TREATMENT WITH AGENTS LIKE CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE AND 5-AZACYTIDINE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE AN INCREASE IN PRE-IMPLANTATION LOSS (PIL) AND POST-IMPLANTATION LOSS (POL). STUDIES FROM OUR LABORATORY HAVE SHOWN THAT PATERNAL TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT INCREASES PIL AND POL. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE PIL OCCURRED AT DAY 2 OF GESTATION (EMBRYO AT 2-4 CELL STAGE) AND THE POL OCCURRED AROUND DAY 9 OF GESTATION (MID-GESTATION). THE INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR (IGF) SYSTEM REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MAJOR GROWTH-CONTROLLING SYSTEM EXPRESSED IN THE EMBRYO. SEVERAL STUDIES SUGGEST THAT IN RODENTS, INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR 2 (IGF2) SIGNALING THROUGH THE INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR TYPE 1 RECEPTOR (IGF1R) MODULATES EMBRYO GROWTH AT AROUND DAYS 9-11 OF GESTATION (MID-GESTATION). THE PRESENT STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO EVALUATE THE EXPRESSION OF IGF2 AND IGF1R TRANSCRIPT BY RT-PCR IN THE POST-IMPLANTATION EMBRYOS OBTAINED AFTER PATERNAL TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT. IT WAS OBSERVED THAT BOTH THE GENES WERE DOWN REGULATED IN RESORBED EMBRYOS (POL). SINCE IGF2 IS AN IMPRINTED GENE AND THE IMPRINT MARK IS ESTABLISHED DURING SPERMATOGENESIS, THE PRESENT STUDY SUGGESTS THAT PATERNAL TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT MAY HAVE AFFECTED IMPRINTING OF THE GENE DURING SPERMATOGENESIS THEREBY DECREASING ITS EXPRESSION AND LEADING TO INCREASE IN POL. THIS IS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THE FIRST STUDY CORRELATING THE INCREASE IN POST-IMPLANTATION EMBRYO LOSS OBTAINED AFTER PATERNAL DRUG TREATMENT WITH THE DECREASE IN THE EXPRESSION OF IGF2 IN THESE EMBRYOS. 2004 WILEY-LISS, INC.",NA,"AZACITIDINE, 320-67-2, 52934-49-3; CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, 50-18-0; SOMATOMEDIN B, 63774-77-6, 67763-97-7; TAMOXIFEN, 10540-29-1; INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR II, 67763-97-7; RECEPTOR, IGF TYPE 1, EC 2.7.1.112; SELECTIVE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR MODULATORS; TAMOXIFEN, 10540-29-1","MREDE","BALASINOR, N.; DIVISION OF NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY, NATL.

PART B DEV. REPROD. TOXICOL.","BACKGROUND: IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION DURING PREGNANCY CAN RESULT IN LOWER BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES BUT MANY WOMEN STOP CONSUMING ALCOHOL PRIOR TO CONCEPTION AS A PART OF PREGNANCY PLANNING. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO DETERMINE WHETHER ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION PRIOR TO CONCEPTION MAY ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT ON FETAL DEVELOPMENT. METHODS: MALE AND FEMALE C57BL/6J MICE AT 4, 6 OR 8 WEEKS OF AGE RECEIVED EITHER A SINGLE ADMINISTRATION OF ALCOHOL (3.0 G/KG) VIA INTRAGASTRIC GAVAGE (IG) EACH DAY FOR AT LEAST 60 DAYS, OR AN ISOVOLUMETRIC IG ADMINISTRATION OF STERILE WATER. AFTER 60 TREATMENT DAYS, MALES AND FEMALES WITHIN EACH AGE AND TREATMENT GROUP WERE MATED OVERNIGHT. FEMALES CONTINUED TO RECEIVE DAILY ALCOHOL TREATMENTS UNTIL CONCEPTION. MALES CONTINUED TO RECEIVE TREATMENTS UNTIL ALL FEMALES WERE SUCCESSFULLY MATED. AT CONCEPTION, FEMALES WERE ISOLATED AND LEFT UNDISTURBED. ON EMBRYONIC DAY 14, FETUS NUMBER, SIZE, AND WEIGHT WAS DETERMINED. RESULTS: MATERNAL FOOD CONSUMPTION, BODY WEIGHT AT CONCEPTION, AND DELAY TO CONCEPTION ONSET DID NOT DIFFER BETWEEN THE TWO TREATMENT GROUPS OR AMONG THE THREE AGE GROUPS. FETAL BODY WEIGHTS DID NOT DIFFER AMONG THE THREE AGE GROUPS. FETUSES FROM FEMALES TREATED WITH ALCOHOL HAD LOWER BODY WEIGHTS COMPARED TO THOSE TREATED WITH WATER. MALE TREATMENTS DID NOT SEEM TO AFFECT FETAL BODY WEIGHT. CONCLUSIONS: FETAL GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT CAN BE AFFECTED BY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION PRIOR TO THE TIME OF CONCEPTION. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION PRIOR TO CONCEPTION IS A POTENTIAL RISK FACTOR TO FETAL OUTCOME AND AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION FOR THOSE FEMALES PLANNING TO HAVE CHILDREN. 2004 WILEY-LISS, INC.",NA,NA,"BDRPC","LIVY, D.J.; DIVISION OF ANATOMY, UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA, EDMONTON, ALTA.

CARCINOG.","TRANSGENERATIONAL CARCINOGENESIS REFERS TO TRANSMISSION OF CANCER RISK TO THE UNTREATED PROGENY OF PARENTS EXPOSED TO CARCINOGENS BEFORE MATING. ACCUMULATED EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE MECHANISM OF THIS PROCESS IS EPIGENETIC, AND MIGHT INVOLVE HORMONAL AND GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES IN OFFSPRING. TO BEGIN TO TEST THIS HYPOTHESIS, WE UTILIZED A MOUSE MODEL (NIH SWISS) IN WHICH EXPOSURE OF FATHERS TO CR(III) CHLORIDE 2 WK BEFORE MATING CAN ALTER INCIDENCE OF NEOPLASTIC AND NONNEOPLASTIC CHANGES IN OFFSPRING TISSUES. UTILIZING A MS-RDA APPROACH, WE FOUND THAT THE SPERM OF THESE FATHERS HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF UNDERMETHYLATED COPIES OF THE 45S RIBOSOMAL RNA GENE (RRNA); THIS FINDING WAS CONFIRMED BY BISULFITE SEQUENCING. BECAUSE GENE METHYLATION IS A KNOWN MECHANISM OF EXPRESSION CONTROL IN GERM CELLS, AND RIBOSOMAL RNA LEVELS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CANCER, THESE FINDINGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HYPOTHESIS. SECONDLY, WE OBSERVED THAT OFFSPRING OF CR(III)-TREATED FATHERS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY HEAVIER THAN CONTROLS, AND HAD HIGHER LEVELS OF SERUM T3. POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF T3 LEVELS ON GENE EXPRESSION IN THE OFFSPRING WERE EXAMINED BY MICROARRAY ANALYSIS OF CDNAS FROM LIVER. A TOTAL OF 58 GENES, INCLUDING 25 NAMED GENES, HAD EXPRESSION RATIOS THAT CORRELATED SIGNIFICANTLY WITH SERUM T3 RATIOS AT P 0.001. SOME OF THESE GENES HAVE POTENTIAL ROLES IN GROWTH AND/OR TUMOR SUPPRESSION. THESE RESULTS ALSO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS OF AN EPIGENETIC AND/OR GENE EXPRESSION-BASED MECHANISM FOR TRANSGENERATIONAL CARCINOGENESIS.",NA,"BISULFITE, 15181-46-1, 7631-90-5, 7773-03-7; CHROMIUM CHLORIDE, 10049-05-5, 39345-92-1; LIOTHYRONINE, 6138-47-2, 6893-02-3; ANTIGENS, CD3; BIOLOGICAL MARKERS; CHLORIDES; CHROMIUM COMPOUNDS; CHROMOUS CHLORIDE, 10049-05-5; DNA, 9007-49-2; DNA, RIBOSOMAL; RNA, RIBOSOMAL; RNA, RIBOSOMAL, 45S","MOCAE","ANDERSON, L.M.; NCI AT FREDERICK, BLDG. 538, FREDERICK, MD 21702, UNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1002/mc.20022",NA,"08991987","MOLECULAR CARCINOGENESIS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,59,"1",NA,"1-11",NA,"15108325","SCOPUS","EPIGENETIC AND GENE EXPRESSION CHANGES RELATED TO TRANSGENERATIONAL CARCINOGENESIS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-2342640893&doi=10.1002%2fmc.20022&partnerID=40&md5=656f1050eaa8371307755bea7ecf03df","40",2004,"NA NA NA","NATIONAL CANCER INSTITUTE","NOTREPORTED;NOTREPORTED",NA,"CHENG RYS, 2004, MOL CARCINOG","CHENG RYS, 2004, MOL CARCINOG"

USING A QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL, WITHIN-SUBJECTS DESIGN, NEUROBEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES (REFLEX ACQUISITION, ACTIVITY, GAIT) AND CEREBRAL CORTICAL LAYER THICKNESS WERE ASSESSED IN SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RAT PUPS FROM BREEDING PAIRS WHERE THE SIRES WERE EXPOSED TO ALCOHOL. COMPARISONS WERE MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE TIMING OF CONCEPTION RELATIVE TO ALCOHOL EXPOSURE: PHASE 1 (CONTROLS), PRIOR TO INITIATION OF ALCOHOL EXPOSURE; PHASE 2, DURING THE PERIOD OF TREATMENT WITH 20% ALCOHOL; AND PHASE 3, FOLLOWING CESSATION OF ALCOHOL EXPOSURE. PHASE 2 AND 3 PUPS WERE NOTED TO ATTAIN NEGATIVE GEOTAXIS AND REFLEX SUSPENSION BENCHMARKS EARLIER THAN CONTROL PUPS AND TO HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY WITH BALANCE. PHASE 3 PUPS WERE NOTED TO ATTAIN RIGHTING REFLEX EARLIER THAN CONTROLS. IN ADDITION, PHASE 3 PUPS DEMONSTRATED INCREASED LEVELS OF REVERSE MAZE ACTIVITY AND A SHORTER AND NARROWER GAIT. BRAIN MORPHOMETRY REVEALED THICKENING OF CORTICAL SECTIONS I-IV AND V-VI RESULTING IN OVERALL CORTICAL ENLARGEMENT IN BOTH PHASE 2 AND 3 PUPS. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF PHASE 2 AND 3 SUBPHASES BASED ON THE PRESUMED STAGES OF THE SPERMATOGENIC CYCLE DURING WHICH SIRES WERE EXPOSED TO ALCOHOL REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MAZE ACTIVITY, REFLEX ACQUISITION, AND GAIT LENGTH.

REPROD.","BACKGROUND. MALE-MEDIATED SPONTANEOUS ABORTION IS WELL DESCRIBED AMONG ANIMALS, BUT LESS WELL DOCUMENTED IN HUMANS. STUDIES THAT INCLUDE EARLY PREGNANCY EXPERIENCE ARE EXPENSIVE TO CONDUCT, BUT IVF PROVIDES NEW OPPORTUNITIES. MATERIALS AND METHODS. THE DANISH IVF REGISTER COVERS ALL IVF TREATMENTS PERFORMED AFTER 1993. WE MAILED A QUESTIONNAIRE TO 5879 WOMEN (RESPONSE RATE 68.2%). A SUBGROUP OF EXPOSED MALE PARTNERS RECEIVED A QUESTIONNAIRE ON SPECIFIC EXPOSURE TO PESTICIDES AND GROWTH RETARDANTS (N = 128 MEN, RESPONSE RATE 81.3%). INFORMATION ON OUTCOME WAS COLLECTED FROM NATIONAL HEALTH REGISTERS. SURVIVAL OF THE FIRST HCG-POSITIVE PREGNANCY WAS ANALYSED USING COX REGRESSION. RESULTS. THE PROPORTION OF PREGNANCIES TERMINATED BY SPONTANEOUS ABORTION BEFORE 28 GESTATIONAL WEEKS WAS 19.7% (N = 66 PREGNANCIES), 19.7% (N = 61), 21.3% (N = 47) AND 22.2% (N = 18) IN PREGNANCIES WITH PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO HERBICIDES, FUNGICIDES, PESTICIDES AND GROWTH RETARDANTS. RESPECTIVELY. IN THE REFERENCE GROUP OF 2925 PREGNANCIES, THE ABORTION RATE WAS 28.4%. THE DIFFERENCES IN SURVIVAL WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. CONCLUSIONS. WE FOUND NO INCREASED RISK OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION IN IVF-TREATED WOMEN ATTRIBUTABLE TO PATERNAL AGRICULTURAL APPLICATION OF PESTICIDES AND GROWTH RETARDANTS. EXPOSURE TO POTENTIALLY HARMFUL PESTICIDES IN DENMARK IS RELATIVELY LOW, AND THE FINDINGS ARE RESTRICTED TO COUNTRIES WITH SIMILAR STANDARDS OF PROTECTION.

WE EXAMINE THE EFFECTS OF OFFSPRING GENOTYPE, MATERNAL AGE AND PATERNAL AGE ON OFFSPRING SURVIVAL, DEVELOPMENT AND ADULT LIFESPAN IN THE SEED BEETLE, CALLOSOBRUCHUS MACULATUS. 2. FEMALES TOOK ABOUT A QUARTER OF A DAY LONGER TO DEVELOP FROM AN EGG TO AN ADULT AND LIVED 7 DAYS LONGER THAN MALES. MORTALITY PATTERNS WERE BEST DESCRIBED BY A LOGISTIC MORTALITY MODEL, AND ALL THREE MODEL PARAMETERS DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE SEXES; FEMALES HAD A HIGHER BASELINE MORTALITY RATE THAN MALES BUT THE MORTALITY RATE INCREASED MORE SLOWLY IN FEMALES THAN IN MALES. FEMALES ALSO SHOWED A DELAY, RELATIVE TO MALES, IN THE AGE AT WHICH MORTALITY BECAME AGE-DEPENDENT. 3. THE PROPORTION OF EGGS THAT HATCHED AND LARVAL SURVIVORSHIP BOTH DECLINED WITH INCREASING MATERNAL AGE, WHILE EGG-TO-ADULT DEVELOPMENT TIME INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY. CONTRARY TO THE PATTERN OBSERVED IN MANY OTHER ORGANISMS, OFFSPRING OF OLDER MOTHERS LIVED LONGER THAN OFFSPRING OF YOUNGER MOTHERS, EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR HETEROGENEITY AMONG FAMILIES. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL AGE AFFECTED ANY OFFSPRING TRAITS. 4. THE EFFECT OF MATERNAL AGE ON OFFSPRING LIFESPAN WAS GREATER FOR MALE OFFSPRING THAN FOR FEMALE OFFSPRING (CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL OBSERVATION THAT THE GENETIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECTING LIFESPAN DIFFER BETWEEN THE TWO SEXES) AND VARIED AMONG SIRE FAMILIES (INDICATING THAT OFFSPRING GENOTYPE MEDIATED THE NON-GENETIC EFFECT OF MATERNAL AGE ON LIFESPAN).",NA,NA,"FECOE","FOX, C.W.; DEPARTMENT OF ENTOMOLOGY, S-225 AGRIC.

HERE THE EFFECTS OF PARENTAL AND GRANDPARENTAL EXPOSURE TO A NON-LETHAL COLD SHOCK ARE CONSIDERED IN DROSOPHILA SERRATA MALLOCH. DEVELOPMENT TIME, VIABILITY AND EARLY AGE PRODUCTIVITY WERE MEASURED IN FLIES ORIGINATING FROM BORDER AND CENTRAL LOCATIONS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THIS SPECIES THAT HAD BEEN HELD UNDER TWO SEPARATE LABORATORY MAINTENANCE SCHEDULES. 2. CROSS-GENERATION EFFECTS WERE DETECTED FOR SEVERAL TRAITS. DEVELOPMENT TIME USUALLY DECREASED FOLLOWING MATERNAL AND/OR GRANDMATERNAL COLD EXPOSURE. PARENTAL COLD EXPOSURE NEGATIVELY INFLUENCED VIABILITY WHILE GRANDPARENTAL EFFECTS ON VIABILITY WERE NEGLIGIBLE. EARLY FEMALE PRODUCTIVITY SHOWED OPPOSING RESPONSES DEPENDING ON GENERATION; MATERNAL COLD EXPOSURE INCREASED PROGENY PRODUCTIVITY WHILE GRANDMATERNAL EXPOSURE DECREASED IT. MALE PARENTAL AND GRANDPARENTAL EXPOSURE TO COLD SHOCK DECREASED MALE PRODUCTIVITY, ALTHOUGH THIS PATTERN MAY HAVE BEEN PARTLY CONFOUNDED BY SIZE EFFECTS. 3. POPULATION EFFECTS, REFLECTING GEOGRAPHICAL ORIGIN, WERE LIMITED TO DEVELOPMENT TIME, WHILE SELECTIVE BACKGROUND EFFECTS WERE DEMONSTRATED FOR MOST TRAITS. THE INFLUENCE THESE FACTORS HAD ON THE EXPRESSION OF CROSS-GENERATION EFFECTS WAS NEGLIGIBLE, GIVEN INTERACTIONS WITH TREATMENT WERE NOT EVIDENT. THESE RESPONSES SUGGEST THAT ENVIRONMENTAL VARIATION EXPERIENCED IN PRECEDING GENERATIONS CAN INFLUENCE PROGENY PHENOTYPE IN A MANNER THAT IS COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO PREDICT.",NA,NA,"FECOE","MAGIAFOGLOU, A.; CTR.

J. BOT.","OFFSPRING TRAIT EXPRESSION IS DETERMINED BY THE COMBINATION OF PARENTAL GENES AND PARENTAL ENVIRONMENTS. ALTHOUGH MATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS HAVE BEEN WIDELY CHARACTERIZED, FEW STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER LIGHT AVAILABILITY INFLUENCES POLLEN AND OFFSPRING TRAITS IN THE WOODLAND HERB CAMPANULA AMERICANA, WE REARED CLONES OF 12 GENOTYPES IN TWO LIGHT LEVELS. IN THE PARENTAL GENERATION WE MEASURED POLLEN NUMBER AND SIZE. PLANTS GROWN UNDER HIGH LIGHT PRODUCED MORE POLLEN GRAINS PER FLOWER THAN THOSE GROWN UNDER LOW LIGHT. HOWEVER, THE RESPONSE WAS GENOTYPE SPECIFIC; SOME INDIVIDUALS RESPONDED LITTLE TO CHANGES IN LIGHT AVAILABILITY WHILE OTHERS SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED POLLEN PRODUCTION. AS A CONSEQUENCE, PATERNITY RATIOS MAY VARY BETWEEN LIGHT ENVIRONMENTS IF MORE POLLEN IS ASSOCIATED WITH GREATER SIRING SUCCESS. WE CROSSED A SUBSET OF THESE PLANTS TO PRODUCE THE OFFSPRING GENERATION. THE PATERNAL AND MATERNAL LIGHT ENVIRONMENTS INFLUENCED OFFSPRING SEED MASS, PERCENTAGE GERMINATION, AND DAYS TO GERMINATION, WHILE ONLY MATERNAL LIGHT LEVELS INFLUENCED LATER LIFE TRAITS, SUCH AS LEAF NUMBER AND SIZE. MATERNAL AND PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS HAD OPPOSITE INFLUENCES ON SEED MASS, PERCENTAGE GERMINATION AND DAYS TO GERMINATION.

THE SECOND MOST USED HERBICIDE WAS A MIXTURE OF 2,4-D AND PICLORAM CALLED AGENT WHITE. THIS STUDY IS AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE POSSIBLE MALE-MEDIATED REPRODUCTIVE TOXICOLOGY OF THIS HERBICIDE. MALE RATS WERE GAVAGED FOR 5 DAYS PER WEEK FOR 9 WEEKS WITH A MIXTURE OF 2,4-D AND PICLORAM CALLED TORDON 75D (THE AUSTRALIAN DERIVATIVE OF AGENT WHITE). THREE DOSES WERE TESTED; THE HIGH DOSE WAS CONSIDERED THE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE. EACH MALE WAS MATED WITH TWO UNTREATED FEMALES DURING WEEKS 2 AND 3, 4 AND 5, AND 8 AND 9 OF TREATMENT, AND WITH FOUR UNTREATED FEMALES AFTER AN 11-WEEK RECOVERY PERIOD. NEGATIVE CONTROLS WERE MALES DOSED WITH DISTILLED WATER, AND POSITIVE CONTROLS WERE MALES DOSED WITH CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE AT 5.1 MG/KG/DAY. ALL MATED FEMALES WERE KILLED ON DAY 20 OF GESTATION, AND THE FETUSES WERE WEIGHED AND EXAMINED FOR EITHER STRUCTURAL MALFORMATIONS OR SKELETAL DEVELOPMENT.

THE DECREASE IN FERTILITY WAS MAINLY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PRE-IMPLANTATION LOSS WITHOUT AN EFFECT ON FERTILIZING ABILITY. DURING THE STUDY, AN INCREASED INCIDENCE OF POST-IMPLANTATION LOSS OF CONCEPTUSES SIRED BY TAMOXIFEN-TREATED MALE RATS WAS OBSERVED. A DETAILED STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN TO INVESTIGATE DOSE-RELATED CHANGES IN PRE- AND POST-IMPLANTATION LOSS AND THE STAGE(S) OF DEVELOPMENT AT WHICH THESE LOSSES OCCURRED. THE PRESENT STUDY DEMONSTRATES THAT TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT PRODUCED FEW NORMAL LITTERS AS WELL AS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED PRE-IMPLANTATION LOSS WITHOUT AFFECTING THE RATE OF FERTILIZATION. ALSO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DEGENERATING EMBRYOS AT THE 2-4-CELL STAGE (DAYS 1-2 OF GESTATION), RETRIEVED FROM THE OVIDUCT/UTERUS OF FEMALES MATED WITH TAMOXIFEN-TREATED MALES WAS OBSERVED. HISTOLOGY OF THE RESORBED FETUSES, IN BOTH CONTROL AND TREATED GROUPS, SHOWED PRESENCE OF TROPHOBLAST OUTGROWTH INDICATIVE OF EARLY PLACENTA FORMATION, WHICH NORMALLY OCCURS ON DAYS 8-9 OF GESTATION. THE PRESENT RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PRE-IMPLANTATION LOSS OCCURRED AT THE 2-4-CELL STAGE AND THE POST-IMPLANTATION LOSS OCCURRED AROUND DAYS 8-9 OF GESTATION, I.E. AROUND MIDGESTATION. THE POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL TAMOXIFEN TREATMENT ON EMBRYOGENESIS MAY BE DUE TO THE REDUCTION OF ANDROGENS OR BY THE BLOCKAGE OF THE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR BY TAMOXIFEN, THEREBY AFFECTING GERM CELL MATURATION DURING SPERMATOGENESIS. 2002 ELSEVIER SCIENCE IRELAND LTD.

THIS STUDY EXAMINES ONE POSSIBLE MECHANISM, NAMELY, ALTERED GENOMIC IMPRINTING AS REFLECTED BY CHANGES IN SPERM CYTOSINE METHYLTRANSFERASE MESSENGER RNA (MRNA) LEVELS. METHODS: MALE RATS WERE TREATED WITH ALCOHOL FOR 9 WEEKS BEFORE BREEDING. RESULTING FETUSES WERE COUNTED AND WEIGHED, AND PATERNAL SPERM WAS EXAMINED FOR CHANGES IN CYTOSINE METHYLTRANSFERASE MRNA LEVELS. RESULTS: ALCOHOL DID NOT AFFECT MATING, FECUNDITY, OR LITTER SIZE, BUT IT DID RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED MEAN FETAL WEIGHT, INCREASED FETAL RUNT INCIDENCE IN OFFSPRING, AND DECREASED CYTOSINE METHYLTRANSFERASE MRNA LEVELS IN PATERNAL SPERM, COMPARED WITH PAIR-FED AND AD LIBITUM CONTROLS. CONCLUSIONS: ALCOHOL-INDUCED REDUCTIONS IN CYTOSINE METHYLTRANSFERASE MRNA LEVELS MAY REFLECT ALTERED GENOMIC IMPRINTING CAUSED BY REDUCED DNA METHYLATION, WHICH, IN TURN, MAY LEAD TO THE EXPRESSION OF NORMALLY SILENT PATERNAL ALLELES AND MAY BE A MECHANISM FOR PATERNAL ALCOHOL EFFECTS.",NA,"ALCOHOL, 64-17-5; CYTOSINE, 71-30-7; DNA, 9007-49-2; METHYLTRANSFERASE, 9033-25-4","ACRSD","ABEL, E.L.; C.

HOWEVER, THE EVOLUTIONARY SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE FINDINGS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE CARRIED OUT LARGE-SCALE DEMOGRAPHIC EXPERIMENTS TO EXAMINE THE DIRECT EFFECT OF MATERNAL AGE AND PATERNAL AGE ON OFFSPRING AGING IN INBRED AND OUTBRED STRAINS OF THE FRUIT FLY DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER. WE FOUND THAT THE AGE OF MOTHERS AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE AGE OF FATHERS CAN HAVE A LARGE INFLUENCE ON BOTH OFFSPRING LONGEVITY AND THE SHAPE OF THE AGE-SPECIFIC MORTALITY TRAJECTORY. IN TWO INDEPENDENT EXPERIMENTS WE FOUND THAT OLDER MOTHERS GENERALLY PRODUCED SHORTER-LIVED OFFSPRING, ALTHOUGH THE EXACT EFFECT OF MATERNAL AGE ON OFFSPRING LONGEVITY DIFFERED AMONG STRAINS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT MATERNAL AGE EFFECTS ON PROGENY AGING MAY INFLUENCE THE EVOLUTION OF AGING.",NA,NA,"EVOLA","PRIEST, N.K.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, 259 GILMER HALL, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22904-4328, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: NKPRIEST@VIRGINIA.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb01405.x",NA,"00143820","EVOLUTION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,113,"5",NA,"927-935","SOCIETY FOR THE STUDY OF EVOLUTION","12093028","SCOPUS","THE ROLE OF PARENTAL AGE EFFECTS ON THE EVOLUTION OF AGING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035987377&doi=10.1111%2fj.0014-3820.2002.tb01405.x&partnerID=40&md5=ec1b510a397b05868b076e132d8a5a3d","56",2002,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA;CHARLOTTESVILLE","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"PRIEST NK, 2002, EVOLUTION","PRIEST NK, 2002, EVOLUTION"

THIS STUDY EXPLORES THE INFLUENCE OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL LIGHT AND NUTRIENT ENVIRONMENTS ON GERMINATION CHARACTERS UNDER NATURAL CONDITIONS IN THE HERBACEOUS PLANT CAMPANULA AMERICANA. FAMILIES WERE GROWN IN A GREENHOUSE UNDER THREE LEVELS OF LIGHT OR THREE LEVELS OF NUTRIENTS, AND CROSSES WERE CONDUCTED WITHIN EACH ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT TO PRODUCE SEEDS WITH ALL COMBINATIONS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTS. SEEDS PRODUCED UNDER THE CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENTS WERE PLANTED INTO THE HOME SITE OF THE POPULATION AND ANOTHER LOCAL SITE, AND GERMINATION WAS MONITORED OVER THE FALL AND SPRING GERMINATING SEASONS. THE PATERNAL LIGHT ENVIRONMENT INFLUENCED PERCENTAGE GERMINATION, DEMONSTRATING THAT THE OFFSPRING PHENOTYPE MAY DEPEND ON THE ENVIRONMENT A SET OF POLLEN DONORS IS GROWN IN. THE EFFECT OF MATERNAL NUTRIENT LEVEL ON PERCENTAGE GERMINATION DEPENDED ON THE OFFSPRING ENVIRONMENT. PERCENTAGE GERMINATION IN RESPONSE TO MATERNAL NUTRIENT AND PATERNAL LIGHT ENVIRONMENTS VARIED AMONG FAMILIES, SUGGESTING THAT THESE PARENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ARE GENETICALLY VARIABLE. BOTH MATERNAL LIGHT AND NUTRIENT ENVIRONMENTS INFLUENCED SEASON OF GERMINATION. GERMINATION SEASON DETERMINES LIFE HISTORY IN C. AMERICANA: FALL-GERMINATING INDIVIDUALS ARE ANNUALS WHILE SPRING-GERMINATING SEEDS ARE BIENNIALS. MATERNAL PLANTS GROWN UNDER LOW AND HIGH LIGHT AND LOW NUTRIENT CONDITIONS PRODUCED MORE BIENNIAL OFFSPRING WHILE THE REMAINING MATERNAL ENVIRONMENTS HAD AN EQUAL FREQUENCY OF ANNUAL AND BIENNIAL OFFSPRING.

ONE PREVIOUS REPORT HAS DEALT WITH THE IMPACT OF ETOH EXPOSURE ON PERIPUBERTAL MALE RATS AS A MODEL OF TEENAGE DRINKING AND THE DELETERIOUS EFFECTS ON THE OFFSPRING. WE REPORT HERE FINDINGS EXAMINING THE EFFECT OF 2 MO OF ETOH FEEDING ON MALE ANIMALS AS THEY PROGRESSED THROUGH PUBERTY ON THEIR ABILITY TO IMPREGNATE ETOH-NAIVE FEMALE RATS AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBSEQUENT LITTERS. THE ETOH-IMBIBING FATHERS WEIGHED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN PAIR-FED CONTROLS AND ANIMALS INGESTING A NON-ETOH LIQUID DIET AD LIBITUM. NEVERTHELESS, THEY WERE ABLE TO MATE SUCCESSFULLY, ALTHOUGH FECUNDITY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED. THE NUMBER OF SUCCESSFUL PREGNANCIES, DEFINED AS CARRIED TO TERM, WAS DIMINISHED FROM 92% IN CONTROLS TO 75% IN ETOH-FED ANIMALS (P < 0.05). THERE WAS INCREASED PATERNAL TESTICULAR OXIDATIVE INJURY DEMONSTRATED BY ENHANCED LIPID PEROXIDATION, PROTEIN OXIDATION, AND DECREASED RATIO OF REDUCED TO OXIDIZED GLUTATHIONE. THE LITTER SIZE OF THE ETOH-EXPOSED MALES WAS REDUCED BY 46%. THE AVERAGE LITTER SIZE WAS 12.4 1.5 PUPS/LITTER IN AD LIBITUM ANIMALS, VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL TO THE 12.5 0.6 PUPS/LITTER IN THE PAIR FED CONTROLS. THIS IS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE 6.7 0.1 PUPS/LITTER FROM THE PATERNAL ETOH MATINGS (P < 0.001). THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE INDIVIDUAL WEIGHT OF PUP OFFSPRING OF PATERNALLY ETOH-EXPOSED ANIMALS (P < 0.01 VS PAIR-FED CONTROLS AND P < 0.05 VS AD LIBITUM). CURIOUSLY, THE MALE-TO-FEMALE PUP RATIO WAS ALTERED WITH A HIGHER PREPONDERANCE OF MALE OFFSPRING FROM ETOH-FED FATHERS. THERE WERE NO GROSS MALFORMATIONS NOTED AMONG THE PUPS. INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR-1 LEVELS IN THE PUPS AT 10 D OF AGE WERE UNALTERED BETWEEN THE GROUPS. HOWEVER, LEPTIN WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ELEVATED IN THE ETOH OFFSPRING. IT APPEARS THAT CHRONIC ETOH EXPOSURE IN THE PERIPUBERTAL FATHERS SUBSEQUENTLY DECREASES FECUNDITY AND THAT THIS MAY BE MEDIATED BY TESTICULAR OXIDATIVE INJURY, PERHAPS LEADING TO ACCELERATED GERM CELL APOPTOSIS.",NA,"ALCOHOL, 64-17-5; GLUTATHIONE DISULFIDE, 27025-41-8; ETHANOL, 64-17-5; GLUTATHIONE, 70-18-8; INSULIN-LIKE GROWTH FACTOR I, 67763-96-6; LEPTIN","EOCRE","EMANUELE, M.A.; DIVISION OF ENDOCRINOLOGY, LOYOLA UNIVERSITY MEDICAL CENTER, BUILDING 117, 2160 SOUTH FIRST AVENUE, MAYWOOD, IL 60153, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: MEMANUE@WPO.IT.LUC.EDU","ARTICLE","10.1385/ENDO:14:2:213","NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTHNATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH","1355008X","ENDOCRINE","ENGLISH",NA,NA,30,"2",NA,"213-219",NA,"11394639","SCOPUS","PERIPUBERTAL PATERNAL ETOH EXPOSURE: TESTICULAR OXIDATIVE INJURY, FECUNDITY, AND OFFSPRING",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035022412&doi=10.1385%2fENDO%3a14%3a2%3a213&partnerID=40&md5=fbc2a03e9c4138b93859974b2b97ebba","14",2001,"THIS RESEARCH WAS SUPPORTED BY GRANT 2POAAA98661-06 FROM THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND BY THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE ON ALCOHOL, ABUSE, AND ALCOHOLISM.

TOXICOL.","EXEMESTANE IS AN ORALLY ACTIVE, IRREVERSIBLE INACTIVATOR OF AROMATASE, STRUCTURALLY RELATED TO THE NATURAL SUBSTRATE ANDROSTENEDIONE, IN CLINICAL USE AT 25 MG DAILY FOR THE TREATMENT OF ADVANCED BREAST CANCER IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN. THE REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY OF EXEMESTANE WAS ASSESSED IN RATS AND RABBITS WITH ORAL ADMINISTRATION. PIVOTAL EXPERIMENTS INCLUDED A FERTILITY STUDY (SEGMENT I), IN WHICH FEMALE RATS RECEIVED EXEMESTANE DOSES OF 4, 20, OR 100 MG/KG/DAY FROM TWO WEEKS PREMATING UNTIL GD 20 (CESAREAN-SECTIONED DAMS), OR UNTIL GD 15 AND THEN FROM D I TO D 21 POSTPARTUM (DAMS ALLOWED TO DELIVER), AND DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY STUDIES (SEGMENT II), IN WHICH RATS AND RABBITS WERE TREATED FROM GD 6 THROUGH GD 17 (RATS) OR GD 18 (RABBITS) AT DOSES OF 10, 50, 250, OR 810 MG/KG/DAY AND 30, 90, OR 270 MG/KG/DAY, RESPECTIVELY. ALL RABBITS AND TWO-THIRDS OF THE RATS WERE CESAREAN SECTIONED TOWARD THE END OF PREGNANCY TO DETERMINE LITTER PARAMETERS AND EXAMINE STRUCTURAL ABNORMALITIES IN THE FETUSES; THE REMAINING ONE-THIRD OF THE RATS WAS ALLOWED TO LITTER AND REAR PUPS TO WEANING. NO PIVOTAL MALE FERTILITY OR PERI- AND POSTNATAL STUDIES WERE PERFORMED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE THERAPEUTIC USE. POSTNATAL EFFECTS ON THE FIRST GENERATION OFFSPRING WERE ASSESSED IN BOTH STUDIES IN RATS, IN THE PORTION OF DAMS ALLOWED TO DELIVER. THEIR FI OFFSPRING WERE RAISED TO ADULTHOOD, WHEN THEY WERE EVALUATED FOR REPRODUCTIVE PERFORMANCE, AND THE FI FEMALES WERE TERMINATED ON GD 20. THE DOSING SCHEDULE FOR THE SEGMENT I STUDY IN RATS, WHICH INCLUDED A POSTNATAL COMPONENT, WAS ESTABLISHED TO EXCLUDE EXPOSURE BEFORE AND DURING PARTURITION (BY WITHDRAWING TREATMENT FROM GD 16 UNTIL THE END OFPARTURITION). THIS WITHDRAWAL OF TREATMENT WAS PUT IN PLACE BECAUSE IN A PRELIMINARY STUDY WITH TREATMENT INCLUDING THE PERIPARTUM PERIOD, DOSES FROM 5 TO 200 MG/KG/DAY PROLONGED GESTATION AND INTERFERED WITH PARTURITION. OVERALL, STUDIES IN RATS SHOWED THAT FEMALE FERTILITY WAS NOT AFFECTED UP TO 100 MG/KG/DAY, BUT DOSES HIGHER THAN 4 MG/KG/DAY, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY THE PHARMACOLOGICALLY ACTIVE DOSE (ED50 = 3.7 MG/KG), PROLONGED GESTATION AND IMPAIRED PARTURITION, LEADING TO MATERNAL DEATHS IN LABOR AND PERINATAL DEATHS OF OFFSPRING. RATS KILLED ON GD 20 SHOWED NONDOSE-RELATED INCREASES IN RESORPTIONS AT DOSES HIGHER THAN 10 MG/KG/DAY, A REDUCTION IN FETAL BODY WEIGHTS AT 20 AND 100 MG/KG/DAY (FERTILITY STUDY) AND 810 MG/KG/DAY (DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY STUDY), AND AN INCREASE IN PLACENTAL WEIGHTS AT ALL DOSES. FEMALE FETUSES EXPOSED IN UTERO UNTIL GD 20 AT 100 MG/KG/DAY SHOWED AN INCREASE IN THE ANOGENITAL DISTANCE, VERY LIKELY RELATED TO AN INCREASE OF THE POTENT ANDROGEN DHT AS A CONSEQUENCE OF AROMATASE INHIBITION. MORPHOLOGIC EXAMINATIONS IN FETUSES AND BORN PUPS THAT WERE EXPOSED IN UTERO UP TO THE END OF THE ORGANOGENESIS PERIOD, AS WELL AS POSTNATAL INVESTIGATIONS ON OFFSPRING UP TO ADULTHOOD, SHOWED NO TREATMENT-RELATED EFFECTS. IN A DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICITY STUDY IN RABBITS, TREATMENT AT 270 MG/KG/DAY AFFECTED MATERNAL FOOD INTAKE AND BODY WEIGHT GAIN, CAUSED ABORTION OR TOTAL RESORPTION IN ABOUT 30% OF PREGNANT FEMALES, AND REDUCED BODY WEIGHT AND NUMBERS OF LIVE FETUSES, BUT DID NOT AFFECT FETAL MORPHOLOGY. IT WAS CONCLUDED THAT EXEMESTANE DID NOT AFFECT PARTURITION IN RATS AT 4 MG/KG/DAY OR PREGNANCY IN RABBITS AT 90 MG/KG/DAY (ABOUT 1.5 AND 70 TIMES THE HUMAN DOSE, RESPECTIVELY, ON A MG/M2 BASIS) AND WAS NOT TERATOGENIC IN RATS AND RABBITS. EXEMESTANE IS MARKETED FOR USE ONLY IN POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN.

HEALTH PERSPECT.","THERE IS CONFLICTING RESEARCH REGARDING AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN FETAL DEATH AND PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO AGENT ORANGE, A PHENOXY HERBICIDE WIDELY USED IN VIETNAM THAT WAS CONTAMINATED WITH 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN (TCDD). MEN WHO WORKED IN THE U.S. FACTORIES THAT PRODUCED AGENT ORANGE WERE EXPOSED TO TCDD AT LEVELS HUNDREDS OF TIMES HIGHER THAN TCDD LEVELS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. WIVES OF TCDD-EXPOSED CHEMICAL WORKERS AND WIVES OF NONEXPOSED NEIGHBORHOOD REFERENTS WERE INTERVIEWED TO DETERMINE REPRODUCTIVE HISTORY. PATERNAL SERUM TCDD LEVEL AT TIME OF CONCEPTION WAS ESTIMATED FOR EACH PREGNANCY USING SERUM SAMPLES TAKEN IN 1987. ESTIMATED TCDD LEVELS OF WORKERS DURING OR AFTER EXPOSURE WERE HIGH (MEDIAN, 254 PPT; RANGE, 3-16,340 PPT) COMPARED TO REFERENT LEVELS (MEDIAN, 6 PPT; RANGE, 2-19 PPT). NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATERNAL TCDD LEVEL AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION AND SPONTANEOUS ABORTION WAS OBSERVED AMONG PREGNANCIES FATHERED BY WORKERS WITH TCDD LEVELS OF < 20 PPT [ODDS RATIO (OR) = 0.77; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), 0.48-1.22], 20 TO < 255 PPT (OR = 0.81; 95% CI, 0.40-1.63), 255 TO < 1,120, (OR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.30-1.58), AND 1,120 PPT (OR = 0.95; 95% CI, 0.42-2.17) COMPARED TO PREGNANCIES FATHERED BY REFERENTS. THE SEX RATIO [MALES/(MALES + FEMALES)] OF OFFSPRING ALSO DID NOT DIFFER BY TCDD EXPOSURE (0.53 AND 0.54 AMONG WORKERS AND REFERENTS, RESPECTIVELY). WE DID NOT FIND AN ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PATERNAL SERUM TCDD LEVEL AND SPONTANEOUS ABORTION OR SEX RATIO OF OFFSPRING IN THIS POPULATION. THE ESTIMATED TCDD LEVELS IN THIS EXPOSED WORKER POPULATION WERE MUCH HIGHER THAN IN OTHER STUDIES, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE THAT PATERNAL TCDD EXPOSURE DOES NOT INCREASE THE RISK OF SPONTANEOUS ABORTION AT LEVELS ABOVE THOSE OBSERVED IN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THE STUDY COULD NOT EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF FATHER'S CHILDHOOD OR PRENATAL TCDD EXPOSURE ON SUBSEQUENT SEX RATIO.",NA,"2,3,7,8 TETRACHLORODIBENZO PARA DIOXIN, 1746-01-6; 2,4,5 TRICHLOROPHENOXYACETIC ACID, 39277-47-9, 93-76-5","EVHPA","SCHNORR, T.; NIOSH, 4676 COLUMBIA PARKWAY, CINCINNATI, OH 45226, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: TSCHNORR@CDC.GOV","ARTICLE","10.1289/ehp.011091127",NA,"00916765","ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES","ENGLISH",NA,NA,56,"11",NA,"1127-1132","PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES, US DEPT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES","11712997","SCOPUS","SPONTANEOUS ABORTION, SEX RATIO, AND PATERNAL OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO 2,3,7,8-TETRACHLORODIBENZO-P-DIOXIN",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0035207034&doi=10.1289%2fehp.011091127&partnerID=40&md5=90c01700cc55f41b88ed2b18a04b6cef","109",2001,"NA NA NA","NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH","SCHNORR;NOTREPORTED;EMAIL: TSCHNORR@CDC.GOV",NA,"SCHNORR TM, 2001, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSPECT","SCHNORR TM, 2001, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSPECT"

HOWEVER, THE EFFECT OF THE PATERNAL ENVIRONMENT OR THE POTENTIAL FOR JOINT EFFECTS OF BOTH PARENTAL ENVIRONMENTS ON OFFSPRING CHARACTERS IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD. TWO POPULATIONS OF CAMPANULA AMERICANA, A WOODLAND HERB WITH A VARIABLE LIFE HISTORY, WERE USED TO DETERMINE THE INFLUENCE OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL LIGHT AND NUTRIENT ENVIRONMENTS ON OFFSPRING SEED CHARACTERS. FAMILIES WERE GROWN IN THE GREENHOUSE IN THREE LEVELS OF LIGHT OR THREE LEVELS OF NUTRIENTS. CROSSES WERE CONDUCTED WITHIN EACH ENVIRONMENTAL GRADIENT TO PRODUCE SEEDS WITH ALL COMBINATIONS OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTS. ON AVERAGE, INCREASING MATERNAL NUTRIENT AND LIGHT LEVELS INCREASED SEED MASS AND DECREASED PERCENTAGE GERMINATION. THE PATERNAL ENVIRONMENT AFFECTED SEED MASS, GERMINATION TIME, AND PERCENTAGE GERMINATION. HOWEVER, THE INFLUENCE OF THE PATERNAL ENVIRONMENT VARIED ACROSS MATERNAL ENVIRONMENTS, SUGGESTING THAT PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS SHOULD BE EVALUATED IN THE CONTEXT OF MATERNAL ENVIRONMENTS. SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FAMILY AND THE PARENTAL ENVIRONMENTS FOR OFFSPRING CHARACTERS SUGGEST THAT PARENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ARE GENETICALLY VARIABLE. IN C. AMERICANA, THE TIMING OF GERMINATION DETERMINES LIFE HISTORY. THEREFORE PARENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS ON GERMINATION TIMING, AND GENETIC VARIATION IN THOSE PARENTAL EFFECTS, SUGGEST THAT PARENTAL ENVIRONMENTS MAY INFLUENCE LIFE HISTORY EVOLUTION IN THIS SYSTEM.",NA,NA,"AJBOA","GALLOWAY, L.F.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, CHARLOTTESVILLE, VA 22903-2477, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: LGALLOWAY@VIRGINIA.EDU","ARTICLE","10.2307/2657035",NA,"00029122","AMERICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,99,"5",NA,"832-840","BOTANICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA INC.",NA,"SCOPUS","THE EFFECT OF MATERNAL AND PATERNAL ENVIRONMENTS ON SEED CHARACTERS IN THE HERBACEOUS PLANT CAMPANULA AMERICANA (CAMPANULACEAE)",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0000250873&doi=10.2307%2f2657035&partnerID=40&md5=aefa3041e6c2a5d485ab22bc021d3f81","88",2001,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA;NOTREPORTED",NA,"GALLOWAY LF, 2001, AM J BOT","GALLOWAY LF, 2001, AM J BOT"

PHARMACOL.","IN THIS STUDY, THE MOUSE WAS USED TO EVALUATE PATERNAL GERMLINE EXPOSURE TO THE ORGANOPHOSPHATE METHAMIDOPHOS FOR ITS POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE ADVERSE EFFECTS ON SPERMATOZOA AND IN THE OFFSPRING. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS THAT ORGANOPHOSPHATE EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE ABNORMAL SPERM MORPHOLOGY IN MICE. HOWEVER, EFFECTS TRANSMITTED TO THE OFFSPRING FOLLOWING PATERNAL EXPOSURE HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED PREVIOUSLY. THE MAXIMUM TOLERATED DOSE (MTD) WAS 7.5 MG KG-1 BODY WEIGHT AND THIS DOSE RESULTED IN NO DEATHS, ALTHOUGH BLOOD PLASMA CHOLINESTERASE ACTIVITY WAS STILL DECREASED. MALES WERE EUTHANIZED 4 WEEKS AFTER AN ACUTE INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTION OF METHAMIDOPHOS (0.5, 3.75, 5.0, AND 7.5 MG KG-1 BODY WT) AND THE NUMBER OF SPERMATIDS PER GRAM TESTES AND SPERM MORPHOLOGY WERE ANALYZED. IN THIS STUDY, ABNORMAL SPERM MORPHOLOGY ON A PER GROUP BASIS EXHIBITED A DOSE-RESPONSE SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO INCREASED METHAMIDOPHOS EXPOSURE AS INDICATED BY REGRESSION ANALYSIS AND A NESTED ANOVA (P &LT; 0.0001). PREIMPLANTATION EMBRYOS THAT WERE CONCEIVED 6 WEEKS AFTER PATERNAL METHAMIDOPHOS EXPOSURE (5 MG KG-1 BODY WT) EXHIBITED A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN CLEAVAGE ARREST. FERTILITY OF MALES WAS ALSO AFFECTED AS SHOWN BY A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF TWO- TO FOUR-CELL EMBRYOS PER MALE (POSTEXPOSURE WEEK 6) AND AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF DEGENERATED EMBRYOS (POSTEXPOSURE WEEKS 4-6). WE CONCLUDE THAT METHAMIDOPHOS MAY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE TRANSMISSIBLE ADVERSE EMBRYONIC EFFECTS FOLLOWING AN ACUTE PATERNAL GERMLINE EXPOSURE.

WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY SHOWN THAT HIGH SERUM CONCENTRATIONS OF TCDD IN PARENTS FROM SEVESO, ITALY, WERE LINKED TO THEIR HAVING A RELATIVE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FEMALE BIRTHS AFTER THE PARENTS EXPOSURE TO A RELEASE OF DIOXIN IN 1976. WE HAVE CONTINUED THE STUDY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE PARENTS' SEX AND/OR AGE AT EXPOSURE AFFECTED THE SEX RATIO OF THEIR CHILDREN. METHODS. WE MEASURED THE TCDD CONCENTRATIONS IN SERUM SAMPLES FROM POTENTIALLY EXPOSED PARENTS COLLECTED IN 1976 AND 1977, AND INVESTIGATED THE SEX RATIO OF THEIR OFFSPRING. FINDINGS. SERUM SAMPLES WERE COLLECTED FROM 239 MEN AND 296 WOMEN. 346 GIRLS AND 328 BOYS WERE BORN TO POTENTIALLY EXPOSED PARENTS BETWEEN 1977 AND 1996, SHOWING AN INCREASED PROBABILITY OF FEMALE BIRTHS (LOWER SEX RATIO) WITH INCREASING TCDD CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SERUM SAMPLES FROM THE FATHERS (P = 0.008). THIS EFFECT STARTS AT CONCENTRATIONS LESS THAN 20 NG PER KG BODYWEIGHT. FATHERS EXPOSED WHEN THEY WERE YOUNGER THAN 19 YEARS OF AGE SIRED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE GIRLS THAN BOYS (SEX RATIO 0.38 [95% CI 0.30-0.47]). INTERPRETATION. EXPOSURE OF MEN TO TCDD IS LINKED TO A LOWERED MALE/FEMALE SEX RATIO IN THEIR OFFSPRING, WHICH MAY PERSIST FOR YEARS AFTER EXPOSURE. THE MEDIAN CONCENTRATION OF DIOXIN IN FATHERS IN THIS STUDY IS SIMILAR TO DOSES THAT INDUCE EPIDIDYMAL IMPAIRMENTS IN RATS AND IS ABOUT 20 TIMES THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE CONCENTRATION OF TCDD CURRENTLY FOUND IN HUMAN BEINGS IN INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES.

WE CONFIRM OUR PRELIMINARY OBSERVATION 3 THAT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF DIOXIN IN SERUM SAMPLES OF PARENTS IN OUR STUDY ARE LINKED TO A LOWER SEX RATIO OF THEIR OFFSPRING. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE SHOWN THAT SERUM DIOXIN CONCENTRATIONS LOWER THAN THOSE ALREADY SHOWN 3 MAY HAVE A SIMILAR EFFECT IF THE FATHER IS EXPOSED. CONCENTRATIONS OF TCDD OF LESS THAN 80 PPT IN SERUM SAMPLES FROM FATHERS WERE A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF THE PROBABILITY OF A MALE BIRTH. TCDD CONCENTRATIONS IN SERUM SAMPLES FROM MOTHERS WERE NOT A SIGNIFICANT PREDICTOR OF THE PROBABILITY OF A MALE BIRTH. FURTHERMORE, MALE EXPOSURE TO TCDD BEFORE AND DURING PUBERTY IS LINKED TO THIS SEX-RATIO EFFECT, AS SEEN BY THEIR OFFSPRING BEING PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE EVEN THOUGH THEIR OFFSPRING WERE CONCEIVED SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE FATHERS' EXPOSURE WHEN CONCENTRATIONS OF DIOXIN IN THEIR SERUM SAMPLES WERE MUCH LOWER. THIS INDICATES THAT THE TIME BEFORE AND DURING PUBERTY MAY BE A VERY SENSITIVE PERIOD FOR DIOXIN TOXICITY IN MEN. THE PREDOMINANCE OF FEMALES AMONG THEIR OFFSPRING RAISES THE VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION OF WHETHER THE LOWERED SEX RATIO IS A RESULT OF A PERMANENT EFFECT FROM THE MOMENT OF EXPOSURE, OR IF IT IS DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF SUFFICIENT CONCENTRATIONS OF DIOXIN IN THEIR BODIES. DATA IN TABLE 5 SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS OF A PERMANENT EFFECT FROM THE MOMENT OF EXPOSURE AMONG MEN WHO WERE EXPOSED BEFORE AND DURING PUBERTY. THIS EFFECT IS EVIDENT BY THE INCREASE OF FEMALE BABIES SIRED BY THESE EXPOSED MEN EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD DIOXIN CONCENTRATIONS OF LESS THAN 30 PPT, AND EVEN LESS THAN 15 PPT, AT THE TIME OF CONCEPTION OF THEIR OFFSPRING. THESE FATHERS, HOWEVER, WERE EXPOSED TO DIOXIN SEVERAL YEARS EARLIER AFTER AN EXPLOSION, AND THUS THEY PREVIOUSLY HAD SERUM CONCENTRATIONS GREATER THAN CONCENTRATIONS MEASURED AT THE TIME THEY CONCEIVED A CHILD. ALTHOUGH THIS STUDY DOES NOT PROVIDE EVIDENCE THAT SERUM DIOXIN CONCENTRATIONS OF AROUND 15 PPT LEAD TO A DECREASED SEX RATIO, THE EVIDENCE OF THIS EFFECT STARTS AT INITIAL TCDD CONCENTRATIONS LOWER THAN 80 PPT (LOWER THAN 16 NG PER KG BODY-WEIGHT). OUR DATA SUPPORT A DIFFERENT ACTION OF TCDD IN THE TWO SEXES, WITH FEMALES BEING INSENSITIVE TO THE EFFECTS OF TCDD. THE MECHANISM FOR REGULATION OF THE NORMAL SEX RATIO OF 0514 IS UNKNOWN. MOST STUDIES HAVE NOT IDENTIFIED A DEVIATION FROM 50% FOR EACH SEX CHROMOSOME. 28 WHETHER A HIGH INCIDENCE OF MISCARRIAGE OF FEMALE FETUSES IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE MALE LIVE BIRTHS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION IS NOT CLEAR. 29 BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE PHYSIOLOGICAL MECHANISM, WE CAN ONLY HYPOTHESISE ABOUT THE ROLE OF DIOXIN IN LOWERING THE SEX RATIO IN HUMAN BEINGS. THE LINK BETWEEN THE MEDIAN 1976 BODY CONCENTRATION OF DIOXIN (ABOUT 20 NG PER KG BODYWEIGHT [RANGE 353960] BASED ON OUR SERUM MEASUREMENTS) IN MEN BEFORE AND DURING PUBERTY, AND THE POSTPUBERTAL EFFECT ON THE SEX RATIO OF OFFSPRING, IS IN AGREEMENT WITH EXPERIMENTAL DATA THAT SHOW A PERMANENTLY ALTERED SPERM-TRANSIT TIME THROUGH THE EPIDIDYMUS 30,31 IN ADULT RATS EXPOSED IN UTERO OR DURING LACTATION TO MOTHERS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO TCDD AT CONCENTRATIONS OF 64 NG PER KG BODYWEIGHT, 30 AND AT 25 NG PER KG BODYWEIGHT. 32 BONDUELLE AND COLLEAGUES 33 FOUND THAT THE SEX RATIO OF CHILDREN BORN AFTER INTRACYTOPLASMIC SPERM INJECTION (ICSI) WITH TESTICULAR OR EPIDIDYMAL SPERMATOZOA WAS MODIFIED TO 040 AND 060, FOR MALES AND FEMALES, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONAL DATA FROM BONDUELLE (PERSONAL COMMUNICATION) SHOW A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE (P=005). IN-UTERO EXPOSURE IS WIDELY CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST SENSITIVE EXPOSURE TIME IN TERMS OF REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS, BUT THE TIME BEFORE AND DURING PUBERTY IS ALSO CONSIDERED QUITE SENSITIVE. 30 THESE EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND OUR OBSERVATION OF THE LOWER SEX RATIO AMONG THE OFFSPRING OF MEN WHO WERE EXPOSED TO DIOXIN DURING ADULTHOOD OR BEFORE AND DURING PUBERTY SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS THAT DIOXIN PERMANENTLY AFFECTS THE HUMAN EPIDIDYMUS FROM THE TIME OF EXPOSURE. ALSO OF INTEREST IS THE FINDING 34 THAT OESTROGEN RECEPTOR PROTEIN IS PRESENT IN HUMAN SPERMATOZOA, WHICH LIKE THE EPIDIDYMUS HAVE AH RECEPTORS. IN ADDITION, ANTIOESTROGENIC DRUGS, SUCH AS CLOMIFENE CITRATE AND TAMOXIFEN, 35 WERE SHOWN TO ENHANCE THE FUNCTIONALITY OF SPERMATOZOA INDUCED BY OESTRADIOL. 36 TO GAIN MORE INSIGHT, IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THE SEX RATIO OF NEWBORNS SIRED BY ASTHENOAZOOSPERMIC MEN WHO HAD BEEN TREATED WITH AN ANTIOESTROGEN SUCH AS TAMOXIFEN. DIOXIN HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN TO HAVE ANTIANDROGENIC PROPERTIES, 30 WHICH COULD CAUSE A CHANGE IN THE SEX RATIO. ANIMAL MODELS ARE NEEDED TO STUDY THESE PHENOMENA. OUR FINDING OF AN ALTERED SEX RATIO IN THE SEVESO POPULATION IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE INCREASE IN FEMALES SIRED BY FATHERS EXPOSED TO CHLOROPHENATES, WHICH ARE KNOWN TO CONTAIN TRACES OF VARIOUS DIOXIN CONGENERS. 12,13 UNFORTUNATELY, THE SERUM DIOXIN CONCENTRATIONS IN THE STUDIES OF THESE OCCUPATIONALLY EXPOSED FATHERS WERE NOT DETERMINED. IN OUR STUDY, THE MEDIAN BODY CONCENTRATIONS IN MEN AND WOMEN LIVING IN 1976 IN THE THREE EXPOSED ZONES, A, B, AND R, WAS ABOUT 20 TIMES THE AVERAGE NORMAL CONCENTRATION OF TCDD IN MEN AND WOMEN IN INDUSTRIALISED COUNTRIES. 37 THE OBSERVED TCDD EFFECTS SEEN IN OUR STUDY STARTED AT CONCENTRATIONS OF LESS THAN 20 NG PER KG BODYWEIGHT.

METHODS: THE STUDY IS DESIGNED AS A COHORT STUDY BASED ON A POPULATION OF 235,635 CHILDREN BORN SHORTLY AFTER TWO DIFFERENT CENSUSES IN SWEDEN. THE CHILDREN WERE FOLLOWED FROM BIRTH TO 14 YEARS AND CASES OF CANCER WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE SWEDISH CANCER REGISTRY. THE PARENTS' OCCUPATIONAL TITLES IN THE CENSUSES WERE LINKED TO A JOB-EXPOSURE MATRIX WITH INFORMATION ABOUT MAGNETIC FIELD LEVELS IN DIFFERENT OCCUPATIONS. THE CANCER INCIDENCE AMONG THE EXPOSED WAS COMPARED TO THAT AMONG THE UNEXPOSED USING COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS MODELING. RESULTS: THERE WAS NO ASSOCIATION BETWEEN CHILDHOOD CANCER AND MATERNAL OCCUPATIONAL MAGNETIC HELD EXPOSURE. PATERNAL EXPOSURE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASED RISK OF CHILDHOOD LEUKEMIA, WITH A RELATIVE RISK OF 2.0 (95% CI 1.1-3.5) FOR EXPOSURES 0.30 T. A DECREASED RISK WAS FOUND FOR BRAIN TUMORS (RR = 0.5; 95% CI 0.3-1.0).

THE CHILDREN'S CANCER GROUP RECENTLY COMPLETED A LARGE-SCALE CASE-CONTROL STUDY INVOLVING 1842 ACUTE LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA (ALL) CASES AND 1986 MATCHED CONTROLS. THE STUDY EXAMINED THE ASSOCIATION OF SELF-REPORTED OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS HYDROCARBONS AMONG PARENTS WITH RISK OF CHILDHOOD ALL BY EXPOSURE TIME WINDOW, IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF ALL, AND AGE AT DIAGNOSIS. WE FOUND THAT MATERNAL EXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS [ODDS RATIO (OR), 1.8; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL (CI), 1.3-2.5] AND PAINTS OR THINNERS (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2) DURING THE PRECONCEPTION PERIOD (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) AND DURING PREGNANCY (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3) AND TO PLASTIC MATERIALS DURING THE POSTNATAL PERIOD (OR, 2.2; 95% CI, 1.0-4.7) WERE RELATED TO AN INCREASED RISK OF CHILDHOOD ALL. A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN ALL AND PATERNAL EXPOSURE TO PLASTIC MATERIALS DURING THE PRECONCEPTION PERIOD WAS ALSO FOUND (OR, 1.4; 95% CI, 1.0-1.9). THE ALL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH PARENTAL EXPOSURES TO HYDROCARBONS DID NOT VARY GREATLY WITH IMMUNOPHENOTYPE OF ALL.

SETTING: MCINTYRE ANIMAL CENTRE, MCGILL UNIVERSITY, MONTREAL, QUEBEC, CANADA. INTERVENTION(S): BROWN NORWAY MALE RATS OF INCREASING AGE WERE MATED TO YOUNG SPRAGUE-DAWLEY FEMALES MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): PREGNANCY OUTCOME WAS ASSESSED BY COUNTING THE NUMBERS OF CORPORA LUTEA, RESORPTIONS, AND LIVE FETUSES ON DAY 20 OF GESTATION. TO EVALUATE PROGENY OUTCOME, PUPS WERE EXAMINED FOR EXTERNAL MALFORMATIONS AND WEIGHED DAILY FOR 2 MONTHS. RESULT(S): THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE NUMBERS OF RESORPTIONS, OFFSPRING, OR IN THE INCIDENCE OF EXTERNAL MALFORMATIONS. HOWEVER, THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN PREIMPLANTATLON LOSS (CORPORA LUTEA MINUS IMPLANTATION SITES) IN LITTERS LATHERED BY OLDER MALES. FURTHERMORE, A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE AVERAGE FETAL WEIGHT WAS FOUND WITH INCREASING PATERNAL AGE. A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN NEONATAL DEATHS FOR PROGENY FATHERED BY OLDER MALES ALSO WAS FOUND. CONCLUSION(S): THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT THE QUALITY OF SPERMATOZOA DECREASES AS MALES AGE.",NA,NA,"FESTA","ROBAIRE, B.; DEPT.

EACH FEMALE WAS MATED WITH ONE MALE AND KILLED AT 6, 8, 10, OR 12 H POSTCOITUS (P.C.). EMBRYOS WERE COLLECTED, AND ZYGOTES IN S-PHASE WERE IDENTIFIED BY IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL TECHNIQUES AFTER PULSE-LABELING WITH 50 M 5-BROMO-2'-DEOXYURIDINE-5'-MONOPHOSPHATE (BRDU) IN TYRODE'S ALBUMIN LACTATE PYRUVATE MEDIUM FOR 30 MIN. IN ANOTHER EXPERIMENT, EMBRYOS AT 6 H P.C. WERE INCUBATED IN 50 M BRDU FOR 6 H. PRESUMPTIVE ZYGOTES WERE STAINED WITH PROPIDIUM IODIDE TO VISUALIZE PRONUCLEI. THE BRDU PULSE-LABELING RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE PERCENTAGES OF EMBRYOS WITH 1 OR 2 PRONUCLEI IN S-PHASE AT 8 H P.C. IN VPX (44.3 10.4) AND TX (41.6 10.6) GROUPS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER (P < 0.05) THAN THAT IN THE SH GROUP (69.0 5.5). IN THE AGX GROUP, ALTHOUGH THE PERCENTAGE OF EMBRYOS WITH I OR 2 PRONUCLEI IN S-PHASE WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE SH GROUP, THE PERCENTAGE OF 8-H EMBRYOS WITH 2 PRONUCLEI IN S-PHASE WAS 51.6 2.8, SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN THE SH CONTROL (68.1 6.0, P < 0.05). WHEN THE EMBRYOS WERE LABELED WITH BRDU FOR 6 H, THE PERCENTAGES OF EMBRYOS WITH 1 OR 2 PRONUCLEI IN S-PHASE WERE NOT DIFFERENT AMONG THE 4 GROUPS. HOWEVER, THE PERCENTAGE OF EMBRYOS SHOWING 2 PRONUCLEI IN S-PHASE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER IN THE AGX GROUP (78.4 6.7) THAN IN THE SH GROUP (91.8 2.9, P < 0.05). THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT ACCESSORY SEX GLANDS CAN AFFECT DNA SYNTHESIS IN HAMSTER ZYGOTES AND THAT THE MECHANISMS BY WHICH AMPULLARY GLAND AND VENTRAL PROSTRATE SECRETIONS AFFECT THE FIRST CELL CYCLE ARE PROBABLY DIFFERENT. A SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER INCIDENCE (P < 0.001) OF POLYSPERMY WAS OBSERVED IN EMBRYOS SIRED BY MALES WITHOUT AMPULLARY GLANDS (5.2 1.0%) COMPARED WITH THOSE SIRED BY THE SH GROUP (0.8 0.3%).",NA,"BROMODEOXYURIDINE, 59-14-3; DNA, 9007-49-2","BIREB","O, W.S.; DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY, FACULTY OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG, 5 SASSOON ROAD, HONG KONG, HONG KONG; EMAIL: OWAISUM@HKUCC.HKU.HK","ARTICLE","10.1095/biolreprod58.3.659",NA,"00063363","BIOLOGY OF REPRODUCTION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,21,"3",NA,"659-663",NA,"9510953","SCOPUS","EFFECTS OF MALE ACCESSORY SEX GLANDS ON DEOXYRIBONUCLEIC ACID SYNTHESIS IN THE FIRST CELL CYCLE OF GOLDEN HAMSTER EMBRYOS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031933236&doi=10.1095%2fbiolreprod58.3.659&partnerID=40&md5=aa6e1536c5ba4a33f75d9c31616e7006","58",1998,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG;CHINESE UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG;UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF HONG KONG;NOTREPORTED",NA,"YING Y, 1998, BIOL REPROD","YING Y, 1998, BIOL REPROD"

BIRTH OUTCOME AND CANCER IN THE OFFSPRING OF FATHERS WHO WERE EXPOSED TO ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS AT TIME OF SPERM PRODUCTION WERE STUDIED IN TWO COHORTS. IN STUDY 1, MALE OCCUPATION IN THE POWER INDUSTRY WAS IDENTIFIED IN CENSUSES. STUDY 2 IS A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF NEWLY EMPLOYED POWER INDUSTRY WORKERS. BIRTH DATA WERE OBTAINED BY RECORD LINKAGE BETWEEN CENSUSES AND SEVERAL AVAILABLE HEALTH REGISTERS IN SWEDEN. MULTIPLE BIRTHS, BIRTH WEIGHT, SEX, SURVIVAL, CONGENITAL MALFORMATIONS, AND CANCER HAVE BEEN ANALYZED WITH RELATION TO THE FATHER'S EXPOSURE TO ELECTRIC AND MAGNETIC FIELDS ONE YEAR BEFORE THE CHILD WAS BORN. THERE WERE SIX CANCER CASES AMONG INFANTS IN THE EXPOSED GROUP (2.4 EXPECTED) AND SIX IN THE UNEXPOSED GROUP (3.2 EXPECTED) IN STUDY 1. JOINTLY, THE 12 CANCER CASES FOUND AMONG THE INFANTS WERE MORE THAN EXPECTED (P = 0.02). HOWEVER, THIS TOTAL EXCESS MAY BE RANDOM. NO CANCER CASES WERE OBSERVED IN THE PROSPECTIVE STUDY. FOR CHROMOSOMAL ABNORMALITIES, SUCH AS DOWN'S SYNDROME, ONE CASE WAS OBSERVED AMONG INFANTS OF EXPOSED FATHERS AND THREE CASES AMONG UNEXPOSED FATHERS IN STUDY 1. IN STUDY 2, NO CASES WERE OBSERVED. THERE WAS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PROPORTION OF MALFORMATION DIAGNOSES AMONG INFANTS OF EXPOSED FATHERS THAN AMONG INFANTS OF UNEXPOSED FATHERS IN STUDY 2, BUT THIS COULD BE RANDOM (ODDS RATIO = 1.59; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL 0.43-1.48).

HEALTH","THE CURRENT STUDY ASSESSED THE EFFECTS OF MATERNAL, PATERNAL, OR COMBINED PARENTAL CONSUMPTION OF LAKE ONTARIO SALMON IN RATS ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THEIR OFFSPRING. ADULT FEMALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE PUT ON A 30 DAY DIET OF EITHER GROUND RAT CHOW CONTAINING 30% LAKE ONTARIO SALMON (LAKE) OR 30% PACIFIC OCEAN SALMON (OCEAN). THESE FEMALES WERE THEN MATED WITH ADULT MALE RATS SIMILARLY EXPOSED (LAKE OR OCEAN). AN ADDITIONAL CONTROL GROUP OF MALES AND FEMALES WHO WERE FED GROUND RAT CHOW (MASH) ONLY WERE ALSO MATED. THESE PAIRING COMBINATIONS RESULTED IN FIVE OFFSPRING GROUPS: LAKE-LAKE, LAKE-OCEAN, OCEAN-LAKE, OCEAN-OCEAN, MASH-MASH. WHEN THE OFFSPRING REACHED 80 DAYS OF AGE, THEY WERE TESTED FOR REACTIVITY TO FRUSTRATIVE NONREWARD USING RUNWAY SUCCESSIVE NEGATIVE CONTRAST, WHICH HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY SHOWN TO BE INCREASED IN ADULT RATS FED ONTARIO SALMON. CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS WORK, RESULTS SHOWED THAT THE BEHAVIOR OF THE OCEAN-OCEAN RATS DID NOT DIFFER FROM THE MASH- MASH GROUP, INDICATING THAT A SALMON DIET PER SE DOES NOT CAUSE BEHAVIORAL CHANGE. HOWEVER, THE OFFSPRING OF DAMS WHO CONSUMED LAKE ONTARIO SALMON (LAKE-LAKE AND OCEAN-LAKE) SHOWED AN INCREASED DEPRESSION EFFECT RELATIVE TO CONTROLS. THERE WAS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF A PATERNAL EFFECT. A FOLLOW-UP EXPERIMENT EMPLOYED CROSS-FOSTERING TO DETERMINE THE RELATIVE CONTRIBUTION OF PRE- AND/OR POSTNATAL EXPOSURE TO LAKE ONTARIO SALMON CONSUMPTION ON OFFSPRING BEHAVIOR. RAT PUPS WERE CROSS-FOSTERED TO OR FROM DAMS WHO CONSUMED LAKE ONTARIO SALMON DURING GESTATION AND PARTURITION. RESULTS FROM TWO SEPARATE REPLICATIONS INDICATED THAT PRENATAL (LAKE TO OCEAN) EXPOSURE ALONE OR POSTNATAL (OCEAN TO LAKE) EXPOSURE ALONE PRODUCED A LARGE INCREASE IN SUCCESSIVE NEGATIVE CONTRAST RELATIVE TO CONTROLS (OCEAN TO OCEAN). THESE DATA ARE STRONG EVIDENCE OF BEHAVIORAL CHANGES PRODUCED BY MATERNAL CONSUMPTION OF LAKE ONTARIO SALMON IN THE OFFSPRING RAT. FURTHER, THEY INDICATE THAT EITHER PRENATAL OR POSTNATAL EXPOSURE ALONE IS SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE BEHAVIORAL CHANGES IN THE OFFSPRING. 1998, SAGE PUBLICATIONS.

SINUSOIDAL MAGNETIC FIELDS AT A FREQUENCY OF 10 KHZ WITH FIELD INTENSITIES OF APPROXIMATELY 0.2 MT ARE GENERATED DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE CURRENT-CARRYING COILS OF THIS EQUIPMENT. EFFECTS OF 10 KHZ MAGNETIC FIELDS ON CELL DIVISION, MIGRATION, AND DIFFERENTIATION HAVE NEVER BEEN PREVIOUSLY INVESTIGATED. TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON THESE PARAMETERS, A RODENT REPRODUCTIVE STUDY WAS UNDERTAKEN USING WISTAR RATS. EXPOSURES WERE AT 0.095, 0.24, AND 0.95 MT WITH A BACKGROUND EXPOSURE OF 5-10 T. THREE SETS OF PARENTAL RATS WERE EXPOSED CONTINUOUSLY FOR 20-23.5 H/DAY TO THE FIELDS: MATERNAL RATS DURING GESTATION, PATERNAL RATS FOR AT LEAST 45 DAYS PRIOR TO MATING AND MATERNAL RATS 1 MONTH PRIOR TO MATING. EXPOSURE PHASES THUS COVERED SPERMATOGENESIS, MATURATION OF THE OVUM AND OVULATION, FERTILIZATION, IMPLANTATION, EMBRYOGENESIS, ORGANOGENESIS, AND MATURATION OF THE FETUS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO PARTURITION. IN ALL EXPERIMENTS PREGNANCY OUTCOME WAS ASSESSED. THESE STUDIES FAILED TO DEMONSTRATE ANY REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY RESULTING FROM MATERNAL OR FETAL EXPOSURE DURING GESTATION OR FOLLOWING PATERNAL OR MATERNAL EXPOSURE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS PRIOR TO MATING. NO QUANTITATIVE OR QUALITATIVE EFFECTS ON SPERMATOGENESIS OCCURRED AFTER EXPOSURE, AND NO EFFECTS ON THE ESTROUS CYCLE OR OVULATION COULD BE DEMONSTRABLY LINKED TO THE 10 KHZ MAGNETIC FIELD EXPOSURE AT 0.095, 0.25, OR 0.95 MT. WHERE POSSIBLE, PARENTAL CLINICAL CHEMISTRY AND HEMATOLOGY WERE ALSO EXAMINED. AS IN MOUSE TOXICOLOGY STUDIES PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, MINOR DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED BETWEEN CONTROL AND TREATED GROUPS. THESE WERE REGARDED AS STATISTICALLY, BUT NOT BIOLOGICALLY, SIGNIFICANT AND COULD NOT CATEGORICALLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO MAGNETIC FIELD EXPOSURE. 1998 WILEY-LISS, INC.",NA,NA,"BIOED","DAWSON, B.V.; DEPARTMENT OF ANATOMY, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND, PRIVATE BAG 92019, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND; EMAIL: B.DAWSON@AUCKLAND.AC.NZ","ARTICLE","10.1002/(SICI)1521-186X(1998)19:3<162::AID-BEM4>3.0.CO;2-#",NA,"01978462","BIOELECTROMAGNETICS","ENGLISH",NA,NA,21,"3",NA,"162-171","WILEY-LISS INC.","9554694","SCOPUS","EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS OF 10 KHZ MAGNETIC FIELDS: A RODENT REPRODUCTIVE STUDY",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0031616816&doi=10.1002%2f%28SICI%291521-186X%281998%2919%3a3%3c162%3a%3aAID-BEM4%3e3.0.CO%3b2-%23&partnerID=40&md5=cf3cf6c7e631bce83af8461fe1750a02","19",1998,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND;UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND;UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND;UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF AUCKLAND;NOTREPORTED",NA,"DAWSON BV, 1998, BIOELECTROMAGNETICS","DAWSON BV, 1998, BIOELECTROMAGNETICS"

BEHAV., 49, PP. 671-67","EVOLUTION","WE INVESTIGATED THE EFFECTS OF DEVELOPMENTAL AND PARENTAL TEMPERATURES ON SEVERAL PHYSIOLOGICAL AND MORPHOLOGICAL TRAITS OF ADULT DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER. FLIES FOR THE PARENTAL GENERATION WERE RAISED AT EITHER LOW OR MODERATE TEMPERATURE (18C OR 25C) AND THEN MATED IN THE FOUR POSSIBLE SEX BY-PARENTAL TEMPERATURE CROSSES. THEIR OFFSPRING WERE RAISED AT EITHER 18C OR 25C AND THEN SCORED AS ADULTS FOR MORPHOLOGICAL (DRY BODY MASS, WING SIZE, AND ABDOMINAL MELANIZATION [FEMALES ONLY]), PHYSIOLOGICAL (KNOCK- DOWN TEMPERATURE, AND THERMAL DEPENDENCE OF WALKING SPEED), AND LIFE HISTORY (EGG SIZE) TRAITS. THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPLICATED, AND THE FACTORIAL DESIGN ALLOWS US TO DETERMINE WHETHER AND HOW PATERNAL, MATERNAL, AND DEVELOPMENTAL TEMPERATURES (AS WELL AS OFFSPRING SEX) INFLUENCE THE VARIOUS TRAITS. SEX AND DEVELOPMENTAL TEMPERATURE HAD MAJOR EFFECTS ON ALL TRAITS. FEMALES HAD LARGER BODIES AND WINGS, HIGHER KNOCK DOWN TEMPERATURES, AND SLOWER SPEEDS (BUT SIMILAR SHAPED PERFORMANCE CURVES) THAN MALES. DEVELOPMENT AT 25C (VERSUS AT 18C) INCREASED KNOCK-DOWN TEMPERATURE, INCREASED MAXIMAL SPEED AND THERMAL PERFORMANCE BREADTH, DECREASED THE OPTIMAL TEMPERATURE FOR WALKING, DECREASED BODY MASS AND WING SIZE, REDUCED ABDOMINAL MELANIZATION, AND REDUCED EGG SIZE. PARENTAL TEMPERATURES INFLUENCED A FEW TRAITS, BUT THE EFFECTS WERE GENERALLY SMALL RELATIVE TO THOSE OF SEX OR DEVELOPMENTAL TEMPERATURE. FLIES WHOSE MOTHER HAD BEEN RAISED AT 25C (VERSUS AT 18C) HAD SLIGHTLY HIGHER KNOCK DOWN TEMPERATURE AND SMALLER BODY MASS. FLIES WHOSE FATHER HAD BEEN RAISED AT 25C HAD RELATIVELY LONGER WINGS. THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL, MATERNAL, AND DEVELOPMENTAL TEMPERATURES SOMETIMES DIFFERED IN DIRECTION THE EXISTENCE OF SIGNIFICANT WITHIN AND BETWEEN- GENERATION EFFECTS SUGGESTS THAT COMPARATIVE STUDIES NEED TO STANDARDIZE THERMAL ENVIRONMENTS FOR AT LEAST TWO GENERATIONS, THAT ATTEMPTS TO ESTIMATE 'FIELD' HERITABILITIES MAY BE UNRELIABLE FOR SOME TRAITS, AND THAT PREDICTIONS OF SHORT-TERM EVOLUTIONARY RESPONSES TO SELECTION WILL BE DIFFICULT.",NA,NA,"EVOLA","GRILL, W.D.; DEPARTMENT OF ZOOLOGY, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS, AUSTIN, TX 78712, UNITED STATES","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"00143820","EVOLUTION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,133,"3",NA,"1205-1218",NA,NA,"SCOPUS","WITHIN- AND BETWEEN-GENERATION EFFECTS OF TEMPERATURE ON THE MORPHOLOGY AND PHYSIOLOGY OF DROSOPHILA MELANOGASTER",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0029661315&partnerID=40&md5=58c03e1bb36bcda70a4a587fb8299d89","50",1996,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON;UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS",NA,"CRILL WD, 1996, EVOLUTION","CRILL WD, 1996, EVOLUTION"

THIS PAPER EXPLORES BOTH THEIR CAUSES AND POTENTIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR THE EVOLUTION OF LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS IN PLANTS. IN A GROWTH CHAMBER EXPERIMENT, I MANIPULATED THE PRE- AND POSTZYGOTIC TEMPERATURES OF BOTH PARENTS OF CONTROLLED CROSSES OF PLANTAGO LANCEOLATA. ALL OFFSPRING TRAITS WERE AFFECTED BY PARENTAL TEMPERATURE. ON AVERAGE, LOW PARENTAL TEMPERATURE INCREASED SEED WEIGHT, REDUCED GERMINATION AND OFFSPRING GROWTH RATE, AND ACCELERATED ONSET OF REPRODUCTION BY 7%, 50%, 5%, AND 47%, RESPECTIVELY, WHEN COMPARED TO THE EFFECTS OF HIGH PARENTAL TEMPERATURE. BOTH PRE- AND POSTZYGOTIC PARENTAL TEMPERATURES (I.E., PRIOR TO FERTILIZATION VS. DURING FERTILIZATION AND SEED SET, RESPECTIVELY) INFLUENCED OFFSPRING TRAITS BUT NOT ALWAYS IN THE SAME DIRECTION. IN ALL CASES, HOWEVER, THE POSTZYGOTIC EFFECT WAS STRONGER. THE PREZYGOTIC EFFECTS WERE MORE OFTEN TRANSMITTED PATERNALLY THAN MATERNALLY. GROWTH AND ONSET OF REPRODUCTION WERE INFLUENCED BOTH DIRECTLY BY PARENTAL TEMPERATURE AS WELL AS INDIRECTLY VIA THE EFFECTS OF PARENTAL TEMPERATURE ON SEED WEIGHT AND GERMINATION. SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN PARENTAL GENOTYPES AND PREZYGOTIC TEMPERATURE TREATMENT (G E INTERACTIONS) SHOW THAT GENOTYPES DIFFER IN THEIR INTERGENERATIONAL RESPONSES TO TEMPERATURE WITH RESPECT TO GERMINATION AND GROWTH. THE DATA SUGGEST THAT TEMPERATURE IS INVOLVED IN BOTH GENETICALLY BASED AND ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED PARENTAL EFFECTS AND THAT PARENTAL TEMPERATURE MAY ACCELERATE THE RATE OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN FLOWERING TIME IN NATURAL POPULATIONS OF P. LANCEOLATA. THE ENVIRONMENTALLY INDUCED TEMPERATURE EFFECTS, AS MEDIATED THROUGH G (PREZYGOTIC) E INTERACTIONS ARE NOT LIKELY TO AFFECT THE RATE OR DIRECTION OF EVOLUTIONARY CHANGE IN THE TRAITS EXAMINED BECAUSE POSTZYGOTIC TEMPERATURE EFFECTS GREATLY EXCEED PREZYGOTIC EFFECTS.",NA,NA,"EVOLA","LACEY, E.P.; DEPARTMENT OF BIOLOGY, EBERHART BUILDING, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA, GREENSBORO, NC 27412, UNITED STATES; EMAIL: LACEYE@GOODALL.UNCG.EDU","ARTICLE",NA,NA,"00143820","EVOLUTION","ENGLISH",NA,NA,82,"2",NA,"865-878",NA,NA,"SCOPUS","PARENTAL EFFECTS IN PLANTAGO LANCEOLATA L.

THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE EFFECT OF DECREASED DIETARY ENERGY INTAKE ON SPERM CONCENTRATION AND TOTAL LIVE SPERM PER MILLILITER OF EJACULATE, WHEREAS THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON EJACULATE VOLUME OR PERCENTAGE DEAD SPERM PER EJACULATE. FOUR GROUPS OF HENS (21 WK OF AGE) WITH 18 HENS PER GROUP, WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EACH MALE DIETARY TREATMENT GROUP. HENS WERE ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATED WITH 50 L NEAT POOLED SEMEN FROM ONE OF THE THREE MALE TREATMENT GROUPS. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR EFFECT OF DIET ON FERTILITY, WITH NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON HATCH OF FERTILE, HATCH OF EGGS SET, OR EMBRYONIC MORTALITY. THERE WAS NO EFFECT OF SIRE ENERGY INTAKE ON OFFSPRING BODY WEIGHTS AT 0, 3, OR 6 WK OF AGE. HENS WERE SIMILARLY ARTIFICIALLY INSEMINATED AND SPERM PENETRATION DETERMINED FOR 9 CONSECUTIVE D POSTINSEMINATION. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT QUADRATIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SPERM PENETRATION OF THE PERIVITELLINE LAYER OVERLYING THE GERMINAL DISC AND DAY POSTINSEMINATION FOR EACH OF THE THREE MALE TREATMENT GROUPS. IN ADDITION, MEAN SPERM PENETRATION WAS 62.3, 42.9, AND 6.6 HOLES IN THE GERMINAL DISC PERIVITELLINE LAYER FOR THE HIGH, MEDIUM, AND LOW ENERGY GROUPS, RESPECTIVELY.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: THIRTY-DAY-OLD MALE SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE GIVEN COCAINE HYDROCHLORIDE (15 MG./KG. BODY WEIGHT, CORRESPONDING TO AN AVERAGE SINGLE DOSE FOR A HEAVY COCAINE USER) EITHER DAILY OR TWICE WEEKLY (WEEKEND GROUP, COCAINE GIVEN ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY) AND MATED WITH PREGNANCY-PROVEN FEMALE RATS AFTER 100 AND 150 DAYS OF EXPOSURE TO THE DRUG. PREGNANCY RATES AND LITTER BIRTH WEIGHTS WERE EVALUATED. SERUM TESTOSTERONE, FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE AND LUTEINIZING HORMONE LEVELS WERE MEASURED IN ALL ADULT RATS. MORPHOLOGIC ANALYSIS OF THE TESTIS ENTAILED THE EVALUATION OF QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE HISTOLOGIC PARAMETERS TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF COCAINE ON VARIOUS STAGES OF SPERMATOGENESIS. RESULTS: AFTER 100 DAYS OF TREATMENT, THE RATS RECEIVING DAILY COCAINE HAD A PREGNANCY RATE OF ONLY 33% VERSUS 86% FOR THE CONTROLS (P <0.05). IN RATS EXPOSED TO COCAINE FOR 150 DAYS THE PREGNANCY RATE WAS 50% COMPARED WITH 100% FOR CONTROLS (P <0.05). THE BIRTH WEIGHTS OF OFFSPRING FROM THE GROUP RECEIVING DAILY COCAINE WAS 10% LESS THAN THAT OF CONTROLS (P <0.05). THE WEIGHT OF THE TESTIS AND EPIDIDYMIS WAS NOT AFFECTED BY COCAINE EXPOSURE. MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS SHOWED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE COCAINE-TREATED GROUPS (BOTH THE DAILY COCAINE AND TWICE WEEKLY COCAINE GROUPS) AND THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTROLS. THE MEAN DIAMETER OF SEMINIFEROUS TUBULES IN THE DAILY AND TWICE WEEKLY COCAINE GROUPS WAS REDUCED WHEN COMPARED WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE CONTROLS. THESE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TREATED GROUPS AND THEIR CONTROLS WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P <0.05). SIMILARLY THE THICKNESS OF THE GERMINAL EPITHELIUM WAS LESS IN THE COCAINE-TREATED GROUPS THAN IN THE CONTROLS (P <0.05). DEGENERATING CELLS WERE MORE NUMEROUS IN BOTH DAILY AND TWICE WEEKLY COCAINE GROUPS THAN THE CONTROLS. FURTHERMORE, THE NUMBER OF STEP VII SPERMATIDS WAS REDUCED IN BOTH DAILY AND TWICE WEEKLY COCAINE GROUPS, A DIFFERENCE THAT WAS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT (P <0.05). CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE THAT CHRONIC ADMINISTRATION OF COCAINE TO PERIPUBERTAL MALE RATS HAS A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THEIR TESTICULAR FUNCTION. EVEN WITH TWICE WEEKLY ADMINISTRATION THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECT ON SPERMATOGENESIS ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT MANIFESTED BY DIMINISHED FERTILITY IN THIS GROUP. THESE FINDINGS CONFIRM THAT CHRONIC ADMINISTRATION OF COCAINE TO MALE RATS CAN HAVE A DELETERIOUS EFFECT ON SPERMATOGENESIS AND FERTILITY.",NA,"COCAINE, 50-36-2","JOURA","DHABUWALA, C.B.; DEPARTMENT OF UROLOGY, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY, HARPER PROFESSIONAL BUILDING, JOHN R.

THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDIES WAS TO EXTEND OUR EARLIER OBSERVATIONS BY EXAMINING THE ACUTE, DIRECT EFFECTS OF MORPHINE EXPOSURE TO MALE RATS ON THEIR FERTILITY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF VIABLE OFFSPRING. SEXUALLY MATURE MALE RATS WERE INJECTED WITH A SINGLE DOSE OF MORPHINE (25 MG/KG) AND 24 HR LATER WERE BRED WITH DRUG-NAIVE FEMALES. FERTILITY RATES (VAGINAL PLUGS AND PREGNANCIES) WERE MONITORED THROUGHOUT THE BREEDING PERIOD AS WAS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFSPRING. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT A LARGE, ACUTE DOSE OF MORPHINE GIVEN TO DRUG-NAIVE MALE RATS 24 HR BEFORE THE INITIATION OF BREEDING HAD NO EFFECT ON FERTILITY RATES, BUT PRODUCED SEVERAL ADVERSE EFFECTS ON FETAL OUTCOME. LITTER SIZES IN MORPHINE-DERIVED OFFSPRING WERE CONSIDERABLY SMALLER THAN IN CONTROLS AND MORTALITY RATES WERE MORE THAN 6 TIMES HIGHER. MOREOVER, MORPHINE-DERIVED MALE, BUT NOT FEMALE, OFFSPRING HAD A SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED SENSITIVITY TO THE ANTINOCICEPTIVE EFFECTS OF MORPHINE. COLLECTIVELY, THESE DATA SUGGEST THAT ACUTE PATERNAL MORPHINE EXPOSURE JUST BEFORE BREEDING WITH DRUG-NAIVE FEMALES HAD NO EFFECT ON FERTILITY, BUT EXERTED NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE VIABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR OFFSPRING. THESE RESULTS REPRESENT THE MOST COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO DATE THAT PATERNAL OPIATE EXPOSURE CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT FETAL OUTCOME AND ARE PARTICULARLY STRIKING IN THAT THEY WERE PRODUCED BY A SINGLE INJECTION OF MORPHINE. WE ARE AWARE OF NO ANIMAL STUDIES, CLINICAL CASES OR ANECDOTAL REPORTS IN HUMANS IN WHICH SUCH A PHENOMENON HAS BEEN DESCRIBED.",NA,"COCAINE, 50-36-2, 53-21-4, 5937-29-1; MORPHINE SULFATE, 23095-84-3, 35764-55-7, 64-31-3; OPIATE, 53663-61-9, 8002-76-4, 8008-60-4; COCAINE, 50-36-2; MORPHINE, 57-27-2","JPETA","CICERO, T.J.; DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, WASHINGTON UNIV.

THESE RESULTS ARE SUPPORTED BY SOME, BUT NOT ALL, ANIMAL STUDIES, AND RESULTS ARE LESS WELL ESTABLISHED AT LOW EXPOSURE LEVELS. BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS IN EXPOSED ANIMAL OFFSPRING HAVE ALSO BEEN OBSERVED, BUT AGAIN NOT IN ALL STUDIES. TO FURTHER EXAMINE THIS PROBLEM, WE CONDUCTED THE PRESENT EXPERIMENTS. ADULT MALE OR FEMALE RATS WERE EXPOSED TO TRACE CONCENTRATIONS OF N2O (0%, 0.1%, 0.5%, OR 1.0% IN AIR) FOR 6 H DAILY EITHER THROUGHOUT GESTATION (FEMALES) OR FOR 9 WEEKS (MALES). OFFSPRING FROM TREATED ADULTS WERE SUBJECTED TO AN EXTENSIVE BEHAVIORAL TEST BATTERY. THERE WERE NO CLEAR DOSE-RESPONSE EFFECTS ON ANY OF EIGHT BEHAVIORAL TESTS FOR ANY OFFSPRING. MATERNAL AND OFFSPRING WEIGHTS WERE NORMAL FROM CONCEPTION THROUGH ADULTHOOD. ADDITIONALLY, WE STUDIED EFFECTS OF N2O ON MALE FERTILITY BY MATING TREATED MALES WITH UNTREATED FEMALES AND EXAMINING UTERINE CONTENTS. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE FOR A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN FERTILITY OF EXPOSED MALES, ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A SMALL DOSE-RELATED TREND FOR RESORPTIONS TO INCREASE AND LIVE BIRTHS TO DECREASE WITH INCREASING PATERNAL N2O EXPOSURE. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE IS LITTLE ALTERATION IN MALE OR FEMALE FERTILITY FOLLOWING CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO LOW LEVELS OF N2O. THERE ARE ALSO NO SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM BEHAVIORAL ALTERATIONS IN OFFSPRING EXPOSED GESTATIONALLY TO TRACE LEVELS OF N2O VIA DAM OR SIRE. 1995.",NA,"NITROUS OXIDE, 10024-97-2; NITROUS OXIDE, 10024-97-2","NETEE","HOLSON, R.R.; DIVISION OF REPRODUCTIVE AND DEVELOPMENTAL TOXICOLOGY, NATIONAL CENTER FOR TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH, JEFFERSON, AR 72079, UNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1016/0892-0362(95)00019-N",NA,"08920362","NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,6,"5",NA,"583-592",NA,"8552005","SCOPUS","BEHAVIORAL TERATOLOGY AND DOMINANT LETHAL EVALUATION OF NITROUS OXIDE EXPOSURE IN RATS",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028882038&doi=10.1016%2f0892-0362%2895%2900019-N&partnerID=40&md5=7c67dfac863488bf92f2ba4b368bad2b","17",1995,"THIS PROJECT WAS FUNDEDB Y THE NATIONAL INSTITUTEF OR DENTALR E- NA NA","NATIONAL CENTER FOR TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH","NOTREPORTED;NATIONAL CENTER FOR TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH",NA,"HOLSON RR, 1995, NEUROTOXICOL TERATOL","HOLSON RR, 1995, NEUROTOXICOL TERATOL"

NEWBORN WEIGHTS (THIRD BREEDING) WERE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY PATERNAL ALCOHOL TREATMENT, BUT FETAL WEIGHTS IN THE FIRST TWO BREEDINGS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IN ASSOCIATION WITH PATERNAL ALCOHOL TREATMENT. THERE WAS ALSO AN ALCOHOL-RELATED INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF MALE FETUSES IN BREEDING ONE, AND AN INCREASE IN PLACENTAL WEIGHTS IN BREEDING TWO; THE PLACENTAL INDEX (PLACENTAL WEIGHT/FETAL WEIGHT) WAS ALSO DECREASED BY PATERNAL ALCOHOL TREATMENT FOR FETUSES IN THE SECOND BREEDING. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST PATERNAL ALCOHOL TREATMENT CAN HAVE EFFECTS ON OFFSPRING BODY WEIGHTS, WHICH ARE NOT OBSERVABLE ONCE FEMALES HAVE GIVEN BIRTH. 1995.",NA,"ETHANOL, 64-17-5","ALCOE","ABEL, E.; DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, THE FETAL ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTER, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY, DETROIT, MI, UNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1016/0741-8329(94)00058-L",NA,"07418329","ALCOHOL","ENGLISH",NA,NA,23,"1",NA,"1-6",NA,"7748508","SCOPUS","A SURPRISING EFFECT OF PATERNAL ALCOHOL TREATMENT ON RAT FETUSES",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0028872537&doi=10.1016%2f0741-8329%2894%2900058-L&partnerID=40&md5=d3eb2f001a5097a16b60ea5aa4a4a2c2","12",1995,"NA NA NA","WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"ABEL E, 1995, ALCOHOL","ABEL E, 1995, ALCOHOL"

THE PURPOSE OF THE PRESENT STUDIES WAS TO EXAMINE WHETHER A SINGLE, ACUTE EXPOSURE TO ALCOHOL INFLUENCES THE SUBSEQUENT ABILITY OF ADULT MALE RATS TO MATE AND PRODUCE HEALTHY AND VIABLE LITTERS. OUR RESULTS SHOWED THAT A RELATIVELY LARGE DOSE OF ALCOHOL 24 HOURS PRIOR TO BREEDING HAD LITTLE EFFECT ON THE MATING BEHAVIOR OF MALE RATS, BUT THERE WERE MARKEDLY FEWER PREGNANCIES IN FEMALES MATED WITH ALCOHOL-EXPOSED MALE RATS THAN IN CONTROLS. OF EQUAL IMPORTANCE, WE FOUND THAT, EVEN WHEN CONCEPTION OCCURRED AND LIVE BIRTHS WERE PRODUCED, THERE WERE STRIKING DIFFERENCES IN FETAL OUTCOME. ALCOHOL-TREATED MALES SIRED MANY FEWER PUPS THAN CONTROL MALES AND THERE WAS A MARKEDLY ENHANCED MORTALITY RATE IN THEIR OFFSPRING.

PATERNAL ALCOHOL TREATMENT RESULTED IN INCREASED ACTIVITY AT EACH AGE FOR 3 G/KG OFFSPRING COMPARED TO PAIR-FED CONTROLS. AD-LIB OFFSPRING DID NOT DIFFER FROM 0 G/KG CONTROLS AT 21 AND 42 DAYS OF AGE. THE SIGNIFICANT EFFECT OF PATERNAL ALCOHOL TREATMENT ON OFFSPRING ACTIVITY AT 90 DAYS, INCLUDING A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR PATERNAL EFFECT, OCCURRED WHEN ALL AMPHETAMINE-TREATED GROUPS WERE POOLED. THE ALCOHOL AMPHETAMINE INTERACTION WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT, BUT A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR PATERNAL ALCOHOL LINEAR AMPHETAMINE INTERACTION INDICATED THAT THE PATERNAL ALCOHOL EFFECT ON ACTIVITY WAS DIFFERENTIALLY RESPONSIVE TO AMPHETAMINE. SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS OF THIS INTERACTION INDICATED A SIGNIFICANT LINEAR PATERNAL ALCOHOL TREND ONLY AT THE HIGH DOSE OF AMPHETAMINE. THESE RESULTS CORROBORATE A PREVIOUS REPORT OF INCREASED ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF OFFSPRING SIRED BY FATHERS TREATED WITH ALCOHOL. THE PRESENCE OF A DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF AMPHETAMINE SUGGESTS THAT THE PATERNAL EFFECT ON ACTIVITY MAY BE MEDIATED BY CATECHOLAMINERGIC ACTIVITY. THE ABSENCE OF SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AD LIB AND 0 G/KG PAIR-FED CONTROLS INDICATES THAT PATERNAL STRESS/UNDERNUTRITION DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OFFSPRING ACTIVITY. 1993.",NA,"AMPHETAMINE, 300-62-9; ETHANOL, 64-17-5","NETEE","ABEL, E.L.; DEPARTMENT OF OBSTETRICS AND GYNECOLOGY, FETAL ALCOHOL RESEARCH CENTER, WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY, DETROIT, MI 48201, UNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1016/0892-0362(93)90063-T",NA,"08920362","NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,22,"6",NA,"445-449",NA,"8302247","SCOPUS","PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE AND HYPERACTIVITY IN RAT OFFSPRING: EFFECTS OF AMPHETAMINE",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0027527483&doi=10.1016%2f0892-0362%2893%2990063-T&partnerID=40&md5=720c2024521783dd16163d4fc7199c29","15",1993,"NA NA NA","WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;WAYNE STATE UNIVERSITY",NA,"ABEL EL, 1993, NEUROTOXICOL TERATOL","ABEL EL, 1993, NEUROTOXICOL TERATOL"

ASKING WHEN IN PREGNANCY ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION CHANGED ALLOWED US TO CALCULATE A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF THE AMOUNT CONSUMED WEEKLY DURING THE FIRST TRIMESTER.

DATA WERE TOO SPARSE TO EXAMINE HIGHER CONSUMTION LEVELS. THERE WAS SOME EVIDENCE THAT CASES MAY HAVE HAD LESS OPPORTUNITY THAN CONTROLS TO DECREASE CONSUMPTION DURING THEIR SHORTER PREGNANCIES, POTENTIALLY BIASING THE ODDS RATIO UPWARD.

TO STUDY THIS EFFECT, SEXUALLY MATURE MALE SPRAGUEDAWLEY RATS WERE ADMINISTERED INTRAPERITONEAL INJECTIONS OF SALINE OR CISPLATINUM (0.5 MG/KG PER DAY) FOR 9 WEEKS. EVERY WEEK, ONE SET OF CONTROL AND TREATED ANIMALS WAS MATED WITH FEMALES IN PROESTRUS. NINETEEN DAYS LATER, THE FEMALES WERE SUBJECTED TO LAPAROTOMY, AND THE NUMBERS OF CORPORA LUTEA, RESORPTIONS, AND NORMAL AND ABNORMAL FETUSES WERE NOTED. IN CONJUNCTION, THE EFFECTS OF TREATMENT ON THE HYPOTHALAMOPITUITARYGONADAL AXIS OF THE TREATED MALES WERE EVALUATED. CISPLATINUMTREATED ANIMALS FAILED TO GROW; THE WEIGHTS OF THE REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS AND THE SPERM COUNTS DECLINED FROM WEEK 2 ONWARD, AND SPERM MOTILITY WAS REDUCED THROUGHOUT THE TESTING PERIOD. CIRCULATING AND INTRATESTICULAR LEVELS OF TESTOSTERONE DECLINED FROM WEEK 3 OF TREATMENT AND FOLLICLESTIMULATING HORMONE LEVELS WERE NOT AFFECTED. SERUM LEVELS OF LUTEINIZING HORMONE DECLINED FROM WEEK 3 AND WERE NOT DETECTABLE FROM WEEK 6 ONWARD. HOWEVER, THE PITUITARY RESPONSE TO GONADOTROPINRELEASING HORMONE WAS INTACT IN ALL TREATED GROUPS. THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN FERTILITY, BUT A PROMINENT INCREASE IN PRE AND POSTIMPLANTATION LOSSES OF FETUSES AFTER CISPLATINUM TREATMENT WAS OBSERVED. THERE WAS ALSO A DECREASE IN THE MALETOFEMALE RATIO OF THE OFFSPRING. A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF MALFORMED AND GROWTHRETARDED FETUSES WAS ALSO FOUND AMONG THE OFFSPRING OF CISPLATINUMTREATED MALES. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT SUBCHRONIC TREATMENT WITH LOW DOSES OF CISPLATINUM MAY AFFECT PROGENY; SUCH EFFECTS ARE SEEN IN ADDITION TO THE APPARENT ALTERATION IN A NUMBER OF MEASURES OF REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTION OF TREATED MALES. 1992 AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ANDROLOGY",NA,"CISPLATIN, 15663-27-1, 26035-31-4, 96081-74-2; CISPLATIN, 15663-27-1; FOLLICLE STIMULATING HORMONE, 9002-68-0; LUTEINIZING HORMONE, 9002-67-9; TESTOSTERONE, 57-85-2",NA,"SEETHALAKSHMI, L.; DIVISION OF UROLOGIC AND TRANSPLANTATION SURGERY, UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL CENTER, WORCESTER, MASSACHUSETTS, 01655, UNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1002/j.1939-4640.1992.tb01630.x",NA,"01963635","JOURNAL OF ANDROLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,25,"1",NA,"65-74",NA,"1551807","SCOPUS","EFFECTS OF SUBCHRONIC TREATMENT WITH CISPLATINUM ON TESTICULAR FUNCTION, FERTILITY, PREGNANCY OUTCOME, AND PROGENY",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0026580305&doi=10.1002%2fj.1939-4640.1992.tb01630.x&partnerID=40&md5=9d90c4ad8e2bb0cfebc7aea66d16ea82","13",1992,"NA NA NA","UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL CENTER","NOTREPORTED;UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS MEDICAL CENTER",NA,"SEETHALAKSHMI L, 1992, J ANDROL","SEETHALAKSHMI L, 1992, J ANDROL"

THER.","THE EFFECTS OF ADOLESCENT MORPHINE EXPOSURE ON THE SEXUAL MATURATION OF MALE RATS, THEIR REPRODUCTIVE CAPACITY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR PROGENY WERE EXAMINED. GROUPS OF PREPUBESCENT MALE RATES (25-27 DAYS OF AGE) WERE IMPLANTED WITH MORPHINE- OR PLACEBO-PELLETS (ONE ON DAY 1, THEN TWO PELLETS ON DAYS 4, 7 AND 10); THE PELLETS WERE NOT REMOVED TO ASSURE THE SUSTAINED RELEASE OF MORPHINE FOR 3 TO 4 WEEKS AND TO AVOID THE CONFOUNDING EFFECTS OF A PRECIPITATED WITHDRAWAL SYNDROME. GROUPS OF ANIMALS WERE SACRIFICED AT WEEKLY INTERVALS THROUGH ADULTHOOD FOR AN ASSESSMENT OF REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINE FUNCTION. A LARGE GROUP, HOWEVER, WAS ALSO BRED WITH DRUG-NAIVE PRIMIPAROUS FEMALES AT 85 DAYS OF AGE (8 WEEKS AFTER MORPHINE OR PLACEBO PELLET IMPLANTATION), WHEN THE ACUTE AND CHRONIC EFFECTS OF MORPHINE ON REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINE PARAMETERS HAD DISSIPATED; THEIR FERTILITY AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MALE AND FEMALE PROGENY WAS CHARACTERIZED. OUR RESULTS INDICATED THAT MORPHINE EXPOSURE DURING ADOLESCENCE LED TO A PRONOUNCED INHIBITION OF A NUMBER OF INDICES OF SEXUAL MATURATION (E.G., SERUM TESTOSTERONE AND LUTEINIZING HORMONE LEVELS AND REDUCED WEIGHTS OF THE TESTES AND SEMINAL VESICLES). BREEDING MORPHINE- AND PLACEBO-IMPLANTED MALE RATS WITH DRUG-NAIVE FEMALES RESULTED IN SMALLER LITERS DERIVED FROM MORPHINE-TREATED FATHERS WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROLS, BUT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE OFFSPRING IN THE TWO GROUPS WERE EQUIVALENT. HOWEVER, UPON REACHING ADULTHOOD, A NUMBER OF SELECTIVE ENDOCRINE DIFFERENCES WERE DETECTED IN MORPHINE-DERIVED OFFSPRING WHEN COMPARED TO CONTROLS. ADULT MALE OFFSPRING OF MORPHINE-TREATED MALES HAD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SERUM TESTOSTERONE AND LUTEINIZING HORMONE LEVELS. HYPOTHALAMIC -ENDORPHIN LEVELS WERE MODESTLY ELEVATED IN MALE ADULT MORPHINE-DERIVED OFFSPRING, BUT THESE DIFFERENCES WERE NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT. ADRENAL WEIGHTS WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER IN MORPHINE-DERIVED MALE OFFSPRING, BUT SERUM CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS WERE WITHIN THE NORMAL RANGE. A SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT PATTERN OF ENDOCRINE DEFICITS WAS OBSERVED IN ADULT FEMALE MORPHINE-DERIVED OFFSPRING. LARGE INCREASES IN SERUM CORTICOSTERONE LEVELS WERE OBSERVED IN FEMALE MORPHINE-DERIVED OFFSPRING AND, IN ADDITION, -ENDORPHIN LEVELS IN THE HYPOTHALAMUS WERE ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER. IN CONTRAST TO THE MALE, NO DIFFERENCES IN REPRODUCTIVE ENDOCRINE STATUS WERE OBSERVED IN ADULT FEMALE MORPHINE-DERIVED OFFSPRING. OUR DATA SUGGEST THAT A PERIOD OF EXPOSURE TO OPIATES DURING ADOLESCENCE CANNOT ONLY INFLUENCE MARKEDLY SEXUAL MATURATION, BUT CAN ALSO HAVE LONG-TERM, SELECTIVE AND GENDER SPECIFIC EFFECTS ON ENDOCRINE FUNCTION IN THEIR OFFSPRING.",NA,"BETA ENDORPHIN, 59887-17-1; CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; GONADORELIN, 33515-09-2, 9034-40-6; LUTEINIZING HORMONE, 39341-83-8, 9002-67-9; MORPHINE, 52-26-6, 57-27-2; TESTOSTERONE, 58-22-0; CORTICOSTERONE, 50-22-6; LUTEINIZING HORMONE, 9002-67-9; MORPHINE, 57-27-2","JPETA","CICERO, T.J.; WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY, SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, DEPARTMENT OF PSYCHIATRY, 4940 AUDUBON AVE., ST.

OFFSPRING SIRED BY ALCOHOL-CONSUMING MALES WERE MORE IMMOBILE REGARDLESS OF DURATION OF PATERNAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION OR HOUSING CONDITIONS (GROUP OR ISOLATED). IMIPRAMINE (5, 15 MG/KG) REVERSED THIS EFFECT SUCH THAT AFTER DRUG TREATMENT, ALCOHOL-SIRED OFFSPRING WERE LESS IMMOBILE THAN CONTROLS. PROPRANOLOL (1, 3 MG/KG) ELIMINATED THE GROUP DIFFERENCES. YOHIMBINE (1, 10 MG/KG) SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED IMMOBILITY IN ALL GROUPS BUT DID NOT REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. METERGOLINE (1 MG/KG) INCREASED IMMOBILITY IN ALL GROUPS BUT DID NOT REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF PATERNAL ALCOHOL EXPOSURE. WHEN RAT OFFSPRING OF ALCOHOL-CONSUMING FATHERS WERE TESTED, THEIR SWIMMING BEHAVIOR WAS OPPOSITE TO THAT OF MICE (I.E., RATS WERE LESS IMMOBILE). HOWEVER, AS OBSERVED IN MICE, THE EFFECT WAS REVERSED BY IMIPRAMINE. THESE RESULTS EXTEND THE EVIDENCE FOR PATERNALLY MEDIATED BEHAVIORAL MUTAGENESIS.

MALES RECEIVING THE 200% EDC DIETS WERE PAIRFED TO THOSE CONSUMING THE 25% EDC DIET. AT APPROXIMATELY 60 DAYS OF AGE, MALE OFFSPRING WERE CHALLENGED WITH 108 COLONY FORMING UNITS OF PSEUDOMONAS AERUGINOSA ONTO THE SCARIFIED CORNEA OF ONE EYE. THE OCULAR RESPONSE WAS THEN EVALUATED MACROSCOPICALLY FOR 4 WEEKS. MALE OFFSPRING SIRED BY ALCOHOLCONSUMING FATHERS EXHIBITED MORE SEVERE OCULAR INFECTION AT 24 HR POSTINFECTION COMPARED WITH MICE SIRED BY CONTROL FATHERS AND, AFTER 8 DAYS POSTINFECTION, MORE CORNEAS OF THE 25% EDCSIRED PROGENY PERFORATED THAN DID THE OTHER GROUPS. AT 30 DAYS AFTER INFECTION, SERUM IMMUNOGLOBULIN TITERS (IGM, IGG, IGA) SPECIFIC TO P. AERUGINOSA WERE DETERMINED BY ELISA. ALTHOUGH THE MAJORITY OF THE MICE WERE UNABLE TO RESTORE CORNEAL CLARITY WITHIN 30 DAYS POSTINFECTION, A STRONG SERUM IGG RESPONSE WAS DETECTED IN POOLED SERA FROM THOSE ANIMALS TESTED. OFFSPRING WERE REINFECTED IN THE CONTRALATERAL CONTROL EYE AT 30 DAYS POSTPRIMARY INFECTION. MOST CONTROL ANIMALS WERE ABLE TO RESTORE CORNEAL CLARITY IN THE CONTRALATERAL CONTROL EYE WITHIN 30 DAYS POSTINFECTION, BUT LESS THAN A THIRD OF THE ALCOHOLSIRED OFFSPRING DID SO. AGAIN, THE POOLED SERA THAT WAS TESTED INDICATED A STRONG HUMORAL RESPONSE, DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN CORNEAL CLARITY. THESE STUDIES INDICATE AN INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO INFECTION AND AN IMPAIRMENT IN RESTORATION OF CORNEAL CLARITY IN OFFSPRING SIRED BY ALCOHOLCONSUMING MALES, WHICH DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE MEDIATED BY SERUM ANTIBODY MECHANISMS.

THE MAJOR EFFECT IN THIS PROGENY GROUP WAS ON BODY WEIGHT; DIABETIC FATHERS (PARTICULARLY MD MALES) MATED WITH NOR FEMALES PRODUCED OFFSPRING WITH SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER JUVENILE BODY WEIGHTS THAN THE CONTROLS (INCREASE OF ~0.5 G). THESE BODY-WEIGHT DISTRIBUTIONS ALSO APPEARED MORE HOMOGENEOUS THAN THE MORE VARIABLE BODY-WEIGHT DISTRIBUTION OF THE CONTROLS. IN CONTRAST, MD MOTHERS (MATED WITH NOR MALES) PRODUCED SECOND-COHORT OFFSPRING WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER AVERAGE BODY WEIGHTS (DECREASE OF ~1-2 G) THAN THE CONTROLS. HOWEVER, IF MD FEMALES WERE MATED WITH MD MALES, THE SECOND-COHORT OFFSPRING HAD BODY-WEIGHT DISTRIBUTIONS THAT APPROACHED THOSE OBSERVED IN CONTROL PROGENY OR IN PROGENY WHERE THE FATHER ALONE WAS DIABETIC.

LITTERS WERE CULLED TO 4 MALES AND 4 FEMALES, AND WERE FOSTERED WITHIN 16 HOURS AFTER BIRTH TO UNTREATED DAMS WHICH HAD DELIVERED THEIR LITTERS WITHIN 48 HOURS PREVIOUSLY. OFFSPRING FROM PATERNALLY OR MATERNALLY EXPOSED ANIMALS PERFORMED AS WELL AS CONTROLS ON DAYS 10-90 IN TESTS OF NEUROMOTOR COORDINATION (ASCENT ON A WIRE MESH SCREEN, ROTOROD), ACTIVITY LEVELS (OPEN FIELD, MODIFIED-AUTOMATED OPEN FIELD, AND RUNNING WHEEL), AND LEARNING ABILITY (AVOIDANCE CONDITIONING AND OPERANT CONDITIONING). IN ADDITION, BRAINS OF 10 21-DAY-OLD PUPS WERE ANALYZED FOR NEUROCHEMICAL DIFFERENCES FROM CONTROLS IN CONCENTRATIONS OF PROTEIN AND THE NEUROTRANSMITTERS ACETYCHOLINE, DOPAMINE, NOREPINEPHRINE, 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE, SUBSTANCE P, MET-ENKEPHALIN, AND -ENDORPHIN. LEVELS OF ACETYLCHOLINE, DOPAMINE, SUBSTANCE P, AND -ENDORPHIN WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED IN THE OFFSPRING OF RATS EXPOSED TO ETHANOL. COMPLEX, BUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN LEVELS OF NOREPINEPHRINE OCCURRED ONLY IN PATERNALLY EXPOSED OFFSPRING. 5-HYDROXYTRYPTAMINE LEVELS WERE REDUCED IN THE CEREBRUM, AND MET-ENKEPHALIN LEVELS WERE INCREASED IN ALL BRAIN REGIONS OF OFFSPRING FROM BOTH MATERNALLY AND PATERNALLY EXPOSED RATS. 1988.",NA,"ALCOHOL, 64-17-5; ETHANOL, 64-17-5; NEUROPEPTIDES; NEUROTRANSMITTERS","NETEE","NELSON, B.K.; DIVISION OF BIOMEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE, NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH, 4676 COLUMBIA PARKWAY, CINCINNATI, OH 45226, UNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1016/0892-0362(88)90062-1","FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATIONFOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION","08920362","NEUROTOXICOLOGY AND TERATOLOGY","ENGLISH",NA,NA,30,"1",NA,"15-22",NA,"2895419","SCOPUS","NEUROCHEMICAL, BUT NOT BEHAVIORAL, DEVIATIONS IN THE OFFSPRING OF RATS FOLLOWING PRENATAL OR PATERNAL INHALATION EXPOSURE TO ETHANOL",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0023841126&doi=10.1016%2f0892-0362%2888%2990062-1&partnerID=40&md5=c869df7f89154397d2ef808d1ca284ba","10",1988,"1THIS RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED UNDER THE GOOD RESEARCH PRACTICES PROGRAM OF OUR DIVISION, WHICH IS BASED UPON THE GUIDELINES OF GOOD LABORATORY PRACTICES ISSUED BY THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION IN 1978.

FIRST LITTERS, CONCEIVED BEFORE IMMUNIZATION OF THE FATHER, HAD SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER ID-1 LEVELS THAN LITTERS CONCEIVED BY THE SAME PARENTAL PAIRS AFTER HYPERIMMUNIZATION OF THE FATHER (P > 0.01). TOTAL ANTI-SACHO LEVELS WERE NOT AFFECTED. THE EFFECT APPEARED TO BE INDEPENDENT OF THE LEVEL OF ID-1 EXPRESSED BY THE FATHER OR GRANDFATHER. NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE IN ID-1 PRODUCTION WAS FOUND BETWEEN OFFSPRING OF ACTIVELY IMMUNE, NEONATALLY ID-1 SUPPRESSED FATHERS AND FATHERS EXPRESSING HIGH LEVELS OF ID-1. WE SUGGEST THAT THE PATERNAL IMMUNOREGULATORY INFLUENCE ACTS VIA THE MATERNAL IMMUNE SYSTEM TO MODIFY THE IDIOTYPE REPERTOIRE EXPRESSED IN THE IMMUNE RESPONSE OF THE OFFSPRING, AND IS NOT THE RESULT OF GENETIC TRANSMISSION OF A TRAIT ACQUIRED BY THE FATHER.

EIGHTEEN MALE YOUNG-ADULT SPRAGUE-DAWLEY RATS WERE EXPOSED TO 25 PPM 2ME 7 HR/DAY, 7 DAYS/WEEK FOR 6 WEEKS; THEY WERE THEN MATED WITH UNTREATED FEMALES WHICH WERE ALLOWED TO DELIVER AND REAR THEIR YOUNG. IN ADDITION, GROUPS OF 15 PREGNANT RATS WERE EXPOSED 7 HR/DAY ON GESTATION DAYS 7-13 OR 14-20 AND ALLOWED TO DELIVER AND REAR THEIR YOUNG. AT BIRTH, LITTERS WERE CULLED TO 4 FEMALES AND 4 MALES FOR BEHAVIORAL TESTING OF NEUROMOTOR FUNCTION, ACTIVITY, AND SIMPLE LEARNING ABILITY ON DAYS 10 THROUGH 90. IN ADDITION, BRAINS FROM NEW BORN AND 21-DAY-OLD OFFSPRING WERE ANALYZED FOR NEUROCHEMICAL DEVIATIONS FROM CONTROLS. NO EFFECTS ON PATERNAL OR MATERNAL ANIMALS, NOR ON THE NUMBER OR WEIGHT OF LIVE OFFSPRING, WERE NOTED. BEHAVIORAL TESTING REVEALED SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES FROM CONTROLS ONLY IN AVOIDANCE CONDITIONING OF OFFSPRING OF MOTHERS EXPOSED ON DAYS 7-13. IN CONTRAST, NEUROCHEMICAL DEVIATIONS WERE OBSERVED IN BRAINS FROM 21-DAY-OLD OFFSPRING FROM THE PATERNALLY EXPOSED GROUP AS WELL AS FROM BOTH MATERNALLY EXPOSED GROUPS; CHANGES WERE NUMEROUS IN THE BRAINSTEM AND CEREBRUM BUT WERE FEWER IN THE CEREBELLUM AND MIDBRAIN. THUS IT APPEARS THAT BOTH PATERNAL AND MATERNAL INHALATION OF 25 PPM 2ME PRODUCES SOME EFFECT WHICH IS REFLECTED IN NEUROCHEMICAL DEVIATIONS IN THE OFFSPRING. 1984.",NA,"2 METHOXYETHANOL, 109-86-4; ACETYLCHOLINE, 51-84-3; CATECHOLAMINES; ETHYLENE GLYCOLS; METHYL CELLOSOLVE, 109-86-4","PBBHA","NELSON, B.K.; DIVISION OF BIOMEDICAL, BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH, 4676 COLUMBIA PARKWAY, CINCINNATI, OH 45226, UNITED STATES","ARTICLE","10.1016/0091-3057(84)90254-5",NA,"00913057","PHARMACOLOGY, BIOCHEMISTRY AND BEHAVIOR","ENGLISH",NA,NA,24,"2",NA,"269-279",NA,"6718454","SCOPUS","BEHAVIORAL AND NEUROCHEMICAL ALTERATIONS IN THE OFFSPRING OF RATS AFTER MATERNAL OR PATERNAL INHALATION EXPOSURE TO THE INDUSTRIAL SOLVENT 2-METHOXYETHANOL",NA,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-0021340836&doi=10.1016%2f0091-3057%2884%2990254-5&partnerID=40&md5=a16d15c44871e775b86e936acea2610b","20",1984,"NA NA NA","BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH;HOWARD UNIVERSITY","NOTREPORTED;BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH",NA,"NELSON BK, 1984, PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV","NELSON BK, 1984, PHARMACOL BIOCHEM BEHAV"

EACH MALE WAS CAGED WITH FOUR UNTREATED FEMALES EACH NIGHT. A NECROPSY WAS PERFORMED ON MALE RATS FOLLOWING THE PERIOD OF MATING AND THE LITTER SIZES, BIRTH AND WEANING WEIGHTS, AND SURVIVAL TO 21 DAYS (NEONATAL MORTALITY) OF THEIR PROGENY WERE EVALUATED. METH-TREATED MALES HAD A REDUCTION IN BODY AND SEMINAL VESICLE WEIGHTS AND IN MATING FREQUENCY, CONFIRMING PRIOR STUDIES. PROGENY OF METH-TREATED MALES (507 PUPS) WERE OF LOWER AVERAGE BIRTH WEIGHT THAN THE 276 CONTROLS. IN ADDITION, IT WAS FOUND THAT PRIOR COPULATION HAD A DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT, RESULTING IN SLIGHTLY HEAVIER CONTROL PUPS BUT SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED BIRTH WEIGHTS IN THE METH GROUP. NEONATAL MORTALITY OF THE METH PROGENY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, WITH 18.2% DEAD BY 21 DAYS COMPARED TO 9.5% OF THE CONTROLS (P &LT; 0.01). THE PRESENT DATA INDICATED THAT MORTALITY WAS RELATED IN A COMPLEX FASHION TO NUMBER OF DRUG EXPOSURES AND PREVIOUS SEXUAL EXPERIENCE OF THE SIRE AND THAT MALE OFFSPRING WERE PARTICULARLY AFFECTED. PONDERAL GROWTH OF SURVIVORS FROM LITTERS WITH HIGH NEONATAL DEATH RATES WAS INHIBITED, WITH FEMALES BEING SIGNIFICANTLY LIGHTER AT 75 AND 132 DAYS OF AGE.

EMBRYOS RECOVERED FROM FEMALES KILLED AT 64, 72, 88 AND 96 H AFTER HCG WERE PULSE LABELED BY INCUBATING IN CULTURE MEDIUM CONTAINING [3H]URIDINE FOR EITHER 5 H (TWO CELL), 90 MIN (FOUR CELL), 45 MIN (EIGHT CELL), 20 MIN (MORULA), OR 10 MIN (BLASTOCYST). THE INCORPORATION OF [3H]URIDINE WAS EXAMINED BY AUTORADIOGRAPHY. FOLLOWING EXPOSURE OF THE PARENTAL FEMALE TO HIGH TEMPERATURE APPROXIMATELY 40 PERCENT OF THE EMBRYOS ARE ARRESTED AT THE TWO CELL STAGE AND FAIL TO INCORPORATE [3H]URIDINE. AN ADDITIONAL 20 PERCENT OF THE TWO CELL EMBRYOS ARE ONLY PARTIALLY AFFECTED IN THAT ONE BLASTOMERE IS ABLE TO UNDERGO A LIMITED NUMBER OF CLEAVAGE DIVISIONS. THE 'CLEAVING' BLASTOMERES OF THESE EMBRYOS DEMONSTRATE A DISTRIBUTION OF ISOTOPE COMPARABLE TO THE BLASTOMERES OF NORMAL EMBRYOS AT THE SAME CHRONOLOGICAL STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. IN CONTRAST, THE INCORPORATION OF ISOTOPE INTO THE 'ARRESTED' BLASTOMERE, IF IT OCCURS, IS CONFINED TO THE NUCLEUS AND NEVER ASSUMES THE PATTERN TYPICAL OF BLASTOMERES AT LATER STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT. PATERNAL HYPERTHERMIA, AN EFFECT CONVEYED BY THE FERTILIZING SPERMATOZOAN, ALLOWS NORMAL EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT DURING THE EARLY CLEAVAGE STAGES. HOWEVER, THE RATE OF DEVELOPMENT IS RETARDED AT THE MORULA STAGE ALTHOUGH BLASTULATION EVENTUALLY OCCURS. A SIGNIFICANT PROPORTION OF EMBRYOS AT THE 8 CELL AND MORULA STAGES ALSO CONTAIN BLASTOMERES WHICH FAIL TO INCORPORATE THE ISOTOPIC PRECURSOR. CONSEQUENTLY, THE RETARDATION IN EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT IS PRECEDED BY A PARTIAL FAILURE TO SYNTHESIZE RNA.
